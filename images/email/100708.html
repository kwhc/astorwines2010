  <strong>4. Zelt Himmel Ries Auslese, Selbach-Oster  (2006) </strong><br />
  The vineyards of the middle Mosel owe their international acclaim to a combination of slate soil, southern exposure, and death-defying<br />
  steepness. With steely minerality and a whiff of botrytis, this offering from Selbach-Oster delivers a mouthful of orchard fruit balanced by<br />
  a healthy dose of acidity.<br />

  unctuous and decadent Riesling is made from individually picked grapes and packed with richness.<br />

  <strong>2. Haardter B&uuml;rgergarten Riesling Auslese, M&uuml;ller-Catoir (2004) </strong><br />

  and structure.<br />

<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong> Riesling &quot;Unplugged,&quot; Tesch          (2006) </strong><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
This Kabinett Trocken comes from several vineyard sites in the Nahe that have been in the family since the 1700s. It shows very focused and concentrated fruit on the palate, yet is thoroughly dry and full of minerals. Look for juicy notes of Meyer lemon (and then try and put your glass down).<br />
