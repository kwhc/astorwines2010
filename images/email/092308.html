    <span class="style2"><span class="style9">Wines of Washington and Oregon </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>House Wine Red, Magnificent Wine Co.          (2005) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">Coming from the Blue Mountains of Walla Walla in Washington, this red blend delighted us as soon as we tried it. Made from Cabernet, Merlot, Syrah, and Cabernet Franc, the House Wine has brambly spice, licorice, and blackberries, with supple tannins and a velvet texture on the finish. The perfect red for grilled meats and strong cheeses.<br />
#14098<br />
  Original Price: $11.99<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Ch. Ste Michelle Eroica Riesling (2005)</strong><br />
  In collaboration with the famed Dr. Loosen estate of Germany's Mosel region, Ch. Ste Michelle has created this wine in the image of the best Old World Rieslings. This has bright raciness, seamlessly woven in with ripe peach flavors and citrusy accents.<br />
  #15977<br />
  Original Price: $22.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Powers Cabernet Sauvignon, Washington   (2006) </strong><br />
  A fantastic mid-weight Cabernet Sauvignon from Washington State that captures the combination of bright acidity, ripe currant-driven fruit, and mineral complexity that makes the best Northwestern reds so food-friendly. Try this with grilled lamb or veal.<br />
  #89999<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Snoqualmie Syrah           (2003)</strong> <br />
  The Rh&ocirc;ne Valley has clearly been a major source of inspiration for American winemakers recently. Syrah was first planted in Washington in the 1970s. This bottle is smoky with earthy aromas of leather and dark berries. Aged in oak (25% new) for less than a year.<br />
  #19774</span><br />
  <span class="style2">Original Price: $10.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Ponzi, Pinot Gris  (2007)  </strong><br />
  A full-bodied, unoaked expression of Pinot Gris with round yellow plums, smoky aromas, and a floral finish. The texture is rich and can easily stand up to any number of fish or white meat dishes.<br />
  #20543<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. A to Z Chardonnay (2006) </strong><br />
  It's quite the success story: This Chardonnay came about through a partnership of the two families that founded A to Z in 2001 - and A to Z is now the fastest-growing winery in the Willamette Valley. Fermented and aged mainly in stainless steel, this white wine has a bright, crisp character.<br />
  #15789<br />
  Original Price: $14.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Nelms Road Cabernet Sauvignon    (2006) </strong><br />
  From young vines planted in eastern Washington, in the Columbia Valley AVA, this bold and lovely Cabernet Sauvignon is very fruit-forward on the palate, with approachable tannins and excellent balance. It shows complex blackcurrant fruit, with eucalyptus and mint on the finish.<br />
  #14439<br />
  Original Price: $19.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Penner-Ash Viognier  (2006) </strong><br />
  A wonderful dry white wine with subtle fruit and floral flavors: citrus and pear take center stage, but a subtle minerality is present as well. The wine is unoaked and aged on the lees for 5 months before bottling.<br />
  #19436<br />
  Original Price: $59.99<br />
  Sale Price: $50.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Alloro Pinot Noir (2006) </strong> <br />
  Especially coming from such a young winery, this is an impressively advanced bottle of Pinot Noir. Its distinct aroma of musk makes it unlike any Oregon wine we've ever had. This is full of mixed red berry flavors and reminds us of a great Burgundy.<br />
  #18200<br />
  Original Price: $39.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $33.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Brandborg &quot;Northern Reach&quot; Pinot Noir   (2005) </strong><br />

  #19838<br />
  Original Price: $28.99<br />

  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Dom. Serene &quot;Evenstad Reserve&quot; Pinot Noir    (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Since its first vintage in 1990, Domaine Serene has produced exquisite estate-grown Pinot Noir  atop the renowned Red Hills of Dundee, Oregon. A spicy, complex red wine that's full of cherries, orange rind, vanilla, and clove.<br />
