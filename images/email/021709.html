    (...our lists go up to 11)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">    Ravenswood Zinfandel, Vintners Blend - 2006  (750<strong> mL</strong>)</span><span class="style2"><br />
  This is Ravenswood's introductory Zinfandel. A full-bodied red with black berry fruit, cherries, and pepper aromas. If you like this Zin, try the rest of their wines: you'll immediately see the family resemblance.<br />
#64744<br />
Original Price: $9.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$8.49<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.   Klinker Brick, Old Vines Zinfandel - 2006   (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This hearty, full-bodied red  comes from Zinfandel vines that are well over 50 years old. Aromas of  dark fruit contrast with fresh herbal notes; this also shows intense  concentration, packed with berry flavors set off by spicy oak.</span> <br />
  #18161<br />
  Original Price: $17.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>     McManis Family Syrah, River Junction - 2007 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Soft and fleshy, with ripe  tannins, complex flavors of blackberry and cherry, and just a touch of  cedar and smoke. This red screams for black pepper-crusted pork loin.</span><br />
  #10990<br />
  Original Price: $9.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $8.49<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.   Dancing Bull Zinfandel - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Entry-level Zin for anyone who  wants to get their feet wet. A bit lighter and friendlier than most,  this Zinfandel nonetheless shows varietally typical flavors of bramble  and dark fruits. Its relatively muted tannins (for a Zin, that is) make  it an extremely versatile food wine.</span><br />
  #86322<br />
  Original Price: $8.99<br />
  Sale Price: $7.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.     Qup&eacute; Syrah, Central Coast - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  A tasty and aromatic Syrah from Qup&eacute;, a specialist in Rh&ocirc;ne grapes. This medium-bodied wine boasts classic Syrah flavors: black fruit and a touch of black pepper.<br />
#87624<br />
Original Price: $15.99 <br />
Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.       Nalle Zinfandel, Dry Creek Valley - 2006 (750 mL)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Lovely raspberry aromas and  dry, earthy aromatics greet the nose, followed by a moderate dose of  oak. This medium-bodied Zin shows good acidity and tannins that are  supportive yet unobtrusive. It has succulent, intense strawberry fruit  on the palate, and a finish that is a touch compressed at the moment.  Lingering earth and light toast notes frame the brambly fruit. This is  an exceptionally civilized California Zinfandel.</span> <br />
  #61284<br />
  Original Price: $28.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Cline Zinfandel, California - 2006  (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Fred Cline has restored some of California's oldest vineyards. Even his value-driven baseline bottling is bona fide old-vine Zinfandel. The age of the vines shows in the intense complexity of this excellent full-bodied red.</span><br />
  #62594<br />
  Original Price: $10.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.      Shannon Ridge Syrah - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This dark mahogany red has  flavors of ripe blackberry and hints of brown sugar. Grilled meats  would pair perfectly with this big, bold and strong Syrah.</span> <br />
  #20875<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.        Dashe &quot;l'Enfant Terrible&quot;, Zinfandel - 2007   (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">What puts this Zin in a class  all its own, apart from its low alcohol and solid tannic structure, is  that it is fermented using natural yeasts, rather than commercial ones.  This gives it all the character of its place of origin, the Alexander  Valley. On the nose, it's full of sweet mixed red and black berries,  but the palate is totally dry. A rare treat from the Zin category.</span> <br />
  #20797<br />
  Original Price: $25.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $22.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.   Arcadian Syrah, Stolpman Vineyard - 2003   (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">These vines are just beginning to show what upper-end Syrah can do in California. A fantastic, spicy red wine showing endless blackberried fruit on the nose, with tar and freshly ground peppercorns.</span><br />
  #15924<br />
  Original Price: $61.99<br />
Sale Price: $42.98</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   Cline Zinfandel Ancient Vines - 2007    (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This mouth-coating Zinfandel  offers flavors of toasted caramel and dark berries. Soft tannins and a  lasting vanilla finish make the Ancient Vine Zin dangerously easy to  drink.</span> <br />
#65011<br />
