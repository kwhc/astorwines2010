  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">With its ruby red color and  aromas of black cherries and plums, this Argentine red is simply one of  the best wines to come out of Mendoza in years. The tannins are  silky-smooth and work perfectly with grilled meats or hard, aged  cheeses.</span> <br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A full-bodied, modern Cabernet Sauvignon full of ripe, dark fruit, and nuanced oak notes. The nose offers notes  of currant, blackberry, and spice while the palate is savory and meaty. </span> <br />

  <strong>7.            Punto Final Malbec Reserva - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This rich red is aged in French  oak for 16 months and then in bottle for a further 6 months. It is deep  violet-red in color, with a nose that reveals a combination of red  fruits and toasty notes from the oak. On the palate it is a complex and  structured wine with a long finish.</span> <br />
#16396<br />
Original Price: $18.99 <br />
Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.  Jelu Syrah - 2006</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Jelu winery, located in the  San Juan region of Argentina, is located at an elevation of 900 feet.  &quot;Jelu&quot; means sun in the native language, and these grapes do in fact  achieve maximum ripeness from all the hot Argentine sun they get.  Blackberry fruit, pepper, and great underlying minerality make this a  tasty and crowd-pleasing wine.</span> <br />
  #14889<br />
  Original Price: $9.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $8.49<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5.  Piazzolla Bonarda, Mendoza - 2008 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The red Bonarda grape variety  is widely grown in Argentina. This is a hearty red wine, free of oak,  that is full of mulberry fruit aromas with a touch of graphite and  thyme on the finish. It goes very well with steak and grilled meats.</span> <br />
  #12805<br />
  Original Price: $6.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $5.94<br />
<br />
  <strong>4.                 Familia Mayol Bonarda - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Bonarda is one of the most  popular and successful red grapes grown in Argentina. This fantastic  wine is from the Mendoza region and gives us everything we want in a  full-bodied red: spice, lush black fruit (blueberries and  blackberries), and medium grip from the tannins.</span> <br />
  #14421<br />
  Original Price: $14.99<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Torront&eacute;s &quot;Plata,&quot; La Rioja - 2008 </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This brilliant white wine is  crafted in northern Argentina&rsquo;s La Rioja region. The Torront&eacute;s grape, a  distant cousin of Muscat, produces distinctively aromatic wines, and we  think they are some of the best bottles to come out of Argentina  lately. The &ldquo;Plata&rdquo; is dry on the palate, with notes of mixed white  flowers, yellow plums, and even some white peppercorn on the finish.  Overall, it has a remarkably fresh character, enabling it to complement  lighter dishes without overwhelming them. It&rsquo;s fresh and surprising  each and every time you open a bottle.</span> <br />
  #17296<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">9.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $7.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.   Benmarco Malbec - 2008 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Susana Balbo makes this supple  and full-bodied red from 50-year-old vines. The age of the vines gives  this wine uncommon richness and concentration, making it an  extraordinarily sophisticated Malbec.</span> <br />
  #75487<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
Sale Price: $16.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   Ros&eacute; of Malbec, Cristobal 1492 - 2008 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Malbec grape was once  popular in Bordeaux, but these days it is mostly associated with  Argentina (the Mendoza region in particular). Here we have a ros&eacute; of  Malbec from Mendoza: it is fully dry, yet bursting with red berry  fruits. With a chill, it is as crisp and delicious as any ros&eacute; we've  tasted.</span> <br />
