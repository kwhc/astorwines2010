  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                     Cour-Cheverny, Dom. de Montcy - 2007</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Cour-Cheverny is an appellation that was invented in order to protect the native Romorantin grape variety. This bottling is delicious and approachable, with stone fruit and raw honey aromas, bright acidity, and rocky minerality.</span> <br />
#21752<br />
Original Price: $16.99<br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$14.44<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.               Menetou-Salon Rouge, Gilbert - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">From the Menetou-Salon appellation, located just west of Sancerre, comes a Pinot Noir that is full of pretty, floral, and supple red berry fruit. There's a cool kiss of mineral on the finish, giving this a fuller feel on the palate.</span> <br />
  #17796<br />
  Original Price: $22.99<br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Anjou Blanc, Ch. Soucherie - 2008 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">From a producer known for exquisite Savenni&egrave;res comes this introductory-level Chenin Blanc. Notes of fresh peach, honeydew, and white flower are balanced by a crisp acidity.</span> <br />
  #16080<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">14.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.            Touraine Sauvignon, Clos Roche Blanche - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">From one of the best hillside sites in the Touraine, on chalky limestone and silex, comes this deceptively easygoing Sauvignon Blanc. It is light on the palate with very fresh fruit flavors, but underneath lies a long, deep mineral structure.</span> <br />
  #23124<br />
  Original Price: $14.99<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.            Anjou &quot;Pur Breton,&quot; Cousin-Leduc - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">&quot;Breton&quot; is the local name for Cabernet Franc, and this one is a complex rendition, full of pomegranate fruit with a touch of leather and spice. Bacchus wholeheartedly approves, and so do we! Don't miss out on this juicy Loire Valley red.</span> <br />
#12851<br />
Original Price: $18.99 <br />
Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.  Anjou Rouge &quot;Les Copines Aussi&quot;, Sablonettes - 2007</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A light and fruity red wine made from the Gamay grape by a natural winemaker. It's light-bodied with red cherry and currant fruit on the palate.</span> <br />
  #11415<br />
  Original Price: $14.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $12.74<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5.  Sancerre, Dom. Buissonnes - 2007 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This white wine is from a family-run estate located in the village of Sury en Vaux. The wine rested on the lees until the April after the vintage. This vital process adds complexities that cannot be duplicated by other means. A great style of smoky Sancerre that's mineral-driven, floral, and bone dry on the finish, making it a marvelous match with fresh oysters.</span> <br />
  #20688<br />
  Original Price: $21.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $18.69<br />
<br />
  <strong>4.                 Quincy &quot;Tr&egrave;s Vieilles Vignes&quot;, Dom. Mardon - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">It's amazing how differently Sauvignon Blanc can express itself in different terroirs. This version comes from the lesser-known Loire region of Quincy. It is remarkably aromatic - reminiscent of a Muscat - and full of white pineapple and citrus fruits on the palate. This dry, unoaked white is made (as the name says) from very old vines.</span> <br />
  #26814<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.  La Boh&egrave;me, Marc Pesnot - 2007 </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">When Marc Pesnot refers to his young vines, he means they're &quot;only&quot; 30-50 years old! Needless to say, this young-vine cuv&eacute;e is quite dense with ripe fruit, balanced out by bracing acidity and great minerality. The nose has seashell hints (typical of eastern Loire Valley soil) mingled with citrus notes. Truly a fresh and lovely offering.</span> <br />
  #21146<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">15.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.    Vouvray &quot;Le Haut Lieu&quot; Sec, Huet - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Just recently released, this dry Vouvray is as fresh as they come. Honey, apricots, and mineral abound on the palate. Balanced and showing impressive finesse, this will settle in bottle nicely for years.</span> <br />
  #19087<br />
  Original Price: $34.99<br />
Sale Price: $29.74</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   Sancerre &quot;M&eacute;lodie,&quot; Gaudry - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Take a sip of Gaudry's brilliant Sancerre and you'll immediately taste the impact that 50-year-old vines can have on a wine. This is well concentrated, showing white fruit, fresh citrus, and floral aromas. Quite simply a gorgeous bottle of wine, and an excellent example of what old vines can do in the right hands.</span> <br />
#17694<br />
Original Price: $23.99<br />
