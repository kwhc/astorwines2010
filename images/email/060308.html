    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Loire Valley    Wines </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Muscadet sur Lie, Ch. de Chesnaie  (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Muscadet is a seriously underrated white wine and a great entry point to the wines of the Loire Valley. It may just be the ultimate accompaniment to seafood: oysters, salmon, sardines, you name it &ndash; if it swims, it&rsquo;s great with Muscadet. This bottle from Ch&acirc;teau de la Chesnaie is aged &ldquo;sur lie&rdquo; (on the yeast), which adds body, richness, and a slight spritz.<br />
#27174<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Gama Sutra, Lemasson (NV)</strong><br />
  Gamay with an earthy, gamey edge. Not for the faint-of-palate, but truly something special for those who seek wines with real character. Lovely dark fruits, leather, and game on the palate, with plenty of mineral-driven tannins on the finish. Feel free to decant this for a good hour before enjoying it.<br />
  #19095<br />
  Sale Price: $22.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Bourgueil &quot;Franc de Pied&quot;, Breton   (2005) </strong><br />
  Certified Organic Cabernet Franc from ungrafted vines. This red wine is full of raw, pure, clean red fruit flavors. Very pretty with a floral perfume and fresh berries and minerals on the finish.<br />
  #12929<br />
  Sale Price:   $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. &quot;Les Mortiers&quot; Coteaux-du-Loir Rouge, Le Briseau         (2005)</strong> <br />
  Made from the peppery Pinot d'Aunis grape variety, a red grape that thrives in the cool climate of the Coteaux du Loir. This dry red wine is packed with white and black pepper on the palate. The fruit is a bit wild and gamey, with intense flavors of wild red berry to match.<br />
  #19466<br />
  Sale Price: $27.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Grolleau &quot;Le Cousin&quot;, Cousin-Leduc (NV )  </strong><br />
  Looking for something new? Try out the little-known Grolleau grape from the Loire valley, which here has produced a pale wine redolent of wild berries and earth. It's just a bit gamey and sanguine on the palate, with great acidity and soft tannins that make it a perfect match for wild game birds.<br />
  #14898<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Chinon Ros&eacute;, Dom. de la Noblaie (2007) </strong><br />
  If you're looking for an exuberant French ros&eacute;, you've found your bottle. This is incredibly fruit-driven with aromas of white flowers and watermelon. Dry but plump, with a touch of mineral on the finish.<br />
  #20190<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Anjou Rouge &quot;Les Copines Aussi&quot;, Sablonettes  (2006) </strong><br />
  A light and fruity red wine made from the Gamay grape variety. It's light-bodied with red cherry and currant fruit on the palate. From a Natural winemaker.<br />
  #11415<br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Anjou Blanc &quot;Pepini&egrave;res&quot;, Jo Pithon    (2004) </strong><br />
  As a firm believer in &quot;letting the wine make itself,&quot; Jo Pithon takes a non-interventionist approach in the cellar. The easiest way to succeed at this is to cultivate healthy grapes, and that's what Pithon has done. This Chenin Blanc is fermented in large oak foudres that give it an earthy character. Dry, honeyed, fresh, and well-mineraled on the finish.<br />
  #19745<br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. &quot;Racines&quot; Les Cailloux du Paradis, Courtois (NV) </strong> <br />
  A red blend made from C&ocirc;t (Malbec) and Cabernet Franc. This wine is feral, mineral-driven, and packed with dark, earthy black fruits; it will change before your eyes. A food wine that will pair very well with rich, rustic meals.<br />
  #23571<br />
  Sale Price: $23.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Sancerre &quot;Croix de Roy&quot;, Lucien Crochet  (2006) </strong><br />
Outstanding, textbook Sancerre. Lucien Crochet is renowned for excellent Loire wines and &quot;La Croix Du Roy&quot; is one of them. Bright citrus fruit with delightful earthy and herbal tones - what great Sancerre should be.<br />
  #27204<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8">You are so Nice, Chaussard   (NV) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Briseau is a bit of a maverick (which is fine by us), and prefers to not be bound by local government rules - hence the unorthodox packaging. This is the best-kept quaffing secret around: made mostly from the Gamay grape, it's a wine we have no problem drinking for hours on end.<br />
