    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Spanish Wines   </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Albari&ntilde;o, Pazo de Se&ntilde;orans    (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">This is Albari&ntilde;o at its best. From R&iacute;as Baixas, which attained D.O. status in 1992, it is slightly saline, with crisp honeysuckle and citrus notes. Pair it with any number of seafood dishes for a seamless experience.<br />
#16100<br />
  Sale Price: $22.09</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Las Rocas de San Alejandro Rosado (2007)</strong><br />
  This juicy ros&eacute; packs a punch. It is made in the Calatayud area of north central Spain with 100% Garnacha fruit, which lends a fleshy spiciness and red berry character. Try this at your next barbecue!<br />
  #13517<br />
  Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Louro Godello, Palacios   (2006) </strong><br />
  Rafael Palacios has produced this delicious, mineral-driven white from younger Godello vines in the Bolo D.O., located in northwest Spain. Two months of oak give the wine a subtly creamy mouthfeel, and it shows notes of grapefruit and honeydew. Absolutely delicious.<br />
  #17900<br />
  Sale Price:   $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Bizkaiko Txakolina, Doniene Gorrondona         (2007)</strong> <br />
  Here is a truly unique wine: made from 150-year-old pre-phylloxera Hondarribi Beltza vines, this is the only red Txakoli we've ever seen! Reminiscent of Loire valley Cabernet Franc, Gorrondona displays aromas of green pepper and spice that give way to a mouthful of crushed minerals and juicy red fruit.<br />
  #20328<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Jaume Mesquida Negre, Mallorca (2005)  </strong><br />
  This is truly a Mediterranean bottling. Made from Callet, a traditional Mallorcan grape, the wine is rich and concentrated, with flavors of black olive, black cherry, and toasted vanilla bursting from the glass..<br />
  #19611<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Bodegas Ercavio Blanco (2007) </strong><br />
  This deliciously light and refreshing Spanish white is made from the Air&eacute;n grape variety, which is actually one of the most widely planted grapes in Spain. &quot;Ercavio&quot; comes from the name of an old Roman settlement. The winemakers stay true to tradition whenever possible: for example, they use clay amphorae to store their wines, just like the ancients did.<br />
  #18167<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Rivola, Abadia Retuerta  (2004) </strong><br />
  From the Sardon del Duero, next door to Ribera, Abadia Retuerta showcases rich, ripe Tempranillo fruit in this well-priced, full-bodied red. Ideal with leg of lamb or beef roasts.<br />
  #57134<br />
  Sale Price:   $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Txakolina, Ameztoi    (2007) </strong><br />
  Drinking this Basque wine is easier than saying the names of the grapes that made it: Hondarribi Zurri and Hondarribi Beltza. Dry and light-bodied with mineral-driven fruit and aromas of grapefruit and lemon. A perfect seafood wine..<br />
  #12280<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Gravonia Rioja Blanco, Lopez de Heredia (1996) </strong> <br />
  1996 is the newly released vintage of Lopez de Heredia's &quot;young&quot; white.  In the flush of youth, this is ready to drink, but of course, shows the complexity of the slow, gentle aging process this house is famous for. Practicing Organic.<br />
  #11424<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Pesquera Tinto Crianza, Ribera del Duero  (2005) </strong><br />
Alejandro Fernandez has worked his magic once again. The Pesquera estate has returned to its former glory: it has been on fire since the historic 2000 vintage, and this bottling may be their best effort yet.<br />
  #19912<br />
  Sale Price: $29.74 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Vi&ntilde;a Tondonia Rosado, Lopez de Heredia   (1997) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  This rosado has a copper-orange color with gold at the rim and red at the core. The nose is a mesmerizing, ever-changing mosaic of orange, cinnamon, tobacco, and stones. On the palate it shows complex flavors of apricot, pomegranate, cinnamon, butterscotch, and cloves, then becomes delicate and ethereal on the finish.<br />
