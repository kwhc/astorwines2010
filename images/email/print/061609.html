<p><span class="style1">Astor's Top Beaujolais Wines </span><span class="style2"><span class="style9"></span>  <br />
    Our lists go   to 11.<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                   Beaujolais Blanc, Ch. du Chatelard - 2007 </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">No, your eyes aren't deceiving  you: this is indeed a white Beaujolais. Chardonnay is by far in the  minority when it comes to wine production in this region. This one is  unoaked, ripe, and pleasantly round in texture. It has also gained  incredible concentration from the impressive age of the vines. Give it  a try tonight!</span> <br />
#19462<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$12.74<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.              Brouilly Vieilles Vignes, Lapalu - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">On the palate this Gamay is  showing the finesse and ease that the best Brouillys offer. With dark  cherries, violets, and a wet, stony finish, this is just brilliant  alongside sausages, ham, and country p&acirc;t&eacute;s.</span> <br />
  #13503<br />
  Original Price: $24.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>               Beaujolais-Villages &quot;La Lutine&quot;, Dom. des Terres Vivantes - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This wine is an irresistibly  lively pink-hued ruby red in the glass, a color that captures the  spirit of the wine. On the nose and palate, the wine gives plenty of  juicy Gamay fruit along with a healthy dose of granite mineral on the  finish. The name &quot;Lutine&quot; means &quot;little elfin girl&quot; - which seems an  apt image to associate with this light, joyous wine. The estate farms  sustainably with no chemical pesticides, and uses only natural yeasts.</span> <br />
  #20993<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">13.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.89<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.        Chiroubles, C. Pacalet - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A wine of character with  distinct terroir. It has an earthy edge, but it&rsquo;s the fruit that shines  here: ripe raspberries, orange rind, cherry, and a touch of musk. Very  fresh and very pretty, yet maintaining a mien of rusticity, the wine is  produced organically, with no sulphur added.</span> <br />
  #11953<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.        Morgon VV, Daniel Bouland - 2007 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">One of the 10 Crus of the Beaujolais region, Morgon is noted for producing wines with darker, more powerful fruit profiles than are typical of the Gamay grape. This one shows excellent character with a rustic, earthy edge that pairs well with the charcuterie (sausages, hams, country p&acirc;t&eacute;s) so widely enjoyed in the wine's region of origin &ndash; not to mention here in NYC.</span><br />
#14222<br />
Original Price: $19.99 <br />
Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.                  Saint-Amour, Dom. des Billards - 2007</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A light and easy-drinking Saint-Amour that is full of red fruit and savory, gamey notes. If you've never tried a wine from this northernmost Beaujolais Cru, now is the time.</span> <br />
  #21749<br />
  Original Price: $17.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $15.29<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. Ch&eacute;nas, C. Pacalet - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The northern part of Beaujolais is divided into ten &quot;Crus,&quot; the smallest of which is known as Ch&eacute;nas. Christophe Pacalet's Ch&eacute;nas bottling, made from Gamay, is a touch gamey, with pure aromas of freshly crushed mixed berries. This is a wine that cries out for food.</span> <br />
  #17123<br />
  Original Price: $19.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $15.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.               R&eacute;gni&eacute;, Georges Descombes - 2008 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This wine is made by the 5th member of the legendary Morgon Gang of Four... it's his R&eacute;gni&eacute;, which goes through a shorter raising process, making for a fruitier, young-drinking wine. Elegant, floral, and full of exuberant Gamay fruit, this is a bottle to chill down and drink on a warm summer evening.</span></span> <br />
  #21707<br />
  Original Price: $23.99<br />
  Sale Price: $20.39<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.          Morgon &quot;C&ocirc;te du Py&quot;, Foillard - 2007</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Coming from Morgon's famous hillside vineyard of the C&ocirc;te du Py, widely considered to produce superior wines, this Morgon possesses sweet black fruit notes while an ethereal body keeps it light and silky on the palate. Jean Foillard produces beautiful, delicate wine year after year.</span> <br />
  #11864<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">29.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Fleurie, Dom. des Grands Fers - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A fantastic Cru Beaujolais from  a phenomenal vintage, with lots of black fruit aromas and violets. It's  just slightly tannic, and while this is a red wine to drink today, it  certainly has enough structure to hold up to rich meat dishes.</span><br />
  #13452<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
Sale Price: $14.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>  Brouilly, Ch. des Tours - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Chateau des Tours has been  producing particularly fine wines of late. This vintage takes full  advantage of their 40-year-old vines. Direct and full on the nose with  classic notes of violets, black cherry, and moist earth. The slightly  solid structure of the vintage supports crisp red berry flavors in the  mouth, with a touch of fresh herbs. Lovely now but will improve with  short-term aging.</span> <br />
#20644<br />
