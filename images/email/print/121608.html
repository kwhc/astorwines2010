  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This tasty white comes from the area of Monção in the Vinho Verde region of northern Portugal.

  This beautiful dry white wine is driven by floral fruits and spicy pear flavors. Unoaked and lightly mineral-driven on the finish, this is a fine choice if you're having seafood tonight.

Sale Price: $6.79<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.  Meia Pipa, Vinho Regional Terras do Sado - 2006 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
A Portuguese treat for lovers of big, plush Napa Valley reds. In this bottle you'll find plenty of voluptuous dark berry flavor and outstanding freshness - a characteristic that too often plays second fiddle to oak in modern wines.   <br />

  <br />

  <br />
  <strong>4. Quinta do Monte d'Oiro, Viognier "Madrigal" - 2006 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong> <br />
  This is a brilliant bottle for the lover of rich, round Viognier from the Rhône. Hints of pear skin mingle with creamy oak nuances on the nose and palate. Despite it's heft, the wine has solid acidity and would pair delightfully with roast chicken.  <br />

  Sale Price: $39.94<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Cardeal Reserva, Touriga Nacional, Dão - 2002 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong> <br />
  Made from Touriga Nacional, this fresh red wine shows firm dark fruit, warm spices, and a gentle touch of fresh tobacco on the finish. It has a great tannic structure that allows it to hold up to big, meaty dishes.   <br />

  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Vinha Barrio, Luis Pato - 2001 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  An earthy red that's medium-bodied and full of red berried fruit. Made from the Baga indigenous grape variety. Another delcious bottle of wine from the excellent estate of Luis Pato.  <br />

A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, Auratus is a Portuguese white that goes beyond your traditional Vinho Verde. Very clean and fresh, this has notes of honey and ripe apples, with vivid acidity and mineral notes.
