<p><span class="style1">Astor's Top Alsatian Wines </span><span class="style2"><span class="style9"></span>  <br />
    Our lists go   to 11.<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                  Pinot Gris Reserve Trimbach - 2004 </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Deep, golden tropical fruit is the theme here. Full-bodied and sublimely flavorful, this wine is incredibly rich yet fully dry, showing great balancing acidity.</span> <br />
#22054<br />
Original Price: $19.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$16.99<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.              Pinot Blanc, Mittnacht - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Pale peach and pear flavors  play against a hint of minerality on this white wine from Alsace. It  finishes long, with a gentle kiss of sweetness.</span> <br />
  #19575<br />
  Original Price: $16.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $14.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>              Riesling &quot;Clos de la Trielle&quot; Baur - 2005 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">From Baur's granite-rich monopole comes this delightfully complex bottle. Stone fruits so ripe they give the illusion of sweetness dance on the nose and palate, giving way to a fully dry wine with bright acidity and a tightly wound mineral finish.</span> <br />
  #20440<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">39.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $33.99<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.        Gentil, Hugel - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This dry wine is made from a  blend of white grapes, and has a pleasing mix of spicy and floral  characteristics. It is a great match for p&acirc;t&eacute; or trout.</span> <br />
  #21784<br />
  Original Price: $12.99<br />
  Sale Price: $10.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.       Riesling, Mittnacht - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This delightfully rich and expressive Riesling displays all the body and minerality that give Alsatian wines their charm. Made on a 20-hectare estate run by two conscientious brothers, this dense, balanced, and lively wine is full of petrol and ripe orchard fruits on the nose and palate.</span><br />
#21595<br />
Original Price: $20.99 <br />
Sale Price: $17.84<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.                 Riesling &quot;Katzenthal,&quot; Binner - 2004</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This unfiltered Riesling is unexpectedly full in body. It shows the classic peach-and-apricot fruit profile of the best examples of this varietal, but there's a good dose of citrus in there as well. Organic.</span> <br />
  #12769<br />
  Original Price: $21.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $18.69<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. Pinot Blanc &quot;Herrenweg&quot;, Baur - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Aromas of white peach and pear greet the nose; this is a soft, easy-drinking white wine with a full, aromatic bouquet.</span> <br />
  #25561<br />
  Original Price: $20.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $18.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.               Pinot Noir &quot;Cuv&eacute;e M&quot;, Laurent Barth - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">In the right hands, the red Pinot Noir grape can even thrive in Alsace. Only a minute amount of &quot;Cuv&eacute;e M&quot; is produced, but we managed to get our hands on some. Full of currants, lithe tannins, and all-around approachable fruit character.</span></span> <br />
  #17338<br />
  Original Price: $29.99<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.         Gewurztraminer, Binner - 2005 </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The aromatics here are a bit reserved, making this a great starter Gew&uuml;rztraminer. This has honeydew and floral undertones on the nose; the palate is dry, with the characteristic viscosity of Alsatian white wines.</span> <br />
  #21300<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">27.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $23.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.              Riesling, W. Gisselbrecht - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span>Here we have an off-dry, fruit-driven white wine that is extremely easy to appreciate. This is great before dinner as an ap&eacute;ritif, and also works well with spicy meals.<br />
  #18939<br />
  Original Price: $13.99<br />
Sale Price: $11.89</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong> Pinot, &quot;C&eacute;page Pinot Noir&quot; Blanc, Jean Pierre Dirler Richard Hamilton Viognier - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is an extremely rare find: a white wine made from Pinot Noir grapes. By immediately separating the grape skins from the juice after crushing, Dirler prevents the finished wine from being imbued with the full red color of the skins. The result is this very dry, faintly copper-tinged wine, which has an earthy nose and a near-saline minerality that emerges with a bit of exposure to air. This bottle is an uncommon treat that is well worth seeking out.</span> <br />
#20080<br />
Original Price: $32.99<br />
Sale Price: $28.04<br />
