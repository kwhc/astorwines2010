    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Hosmer Winery Seyval Blanc, Cayuga Lake (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">The Seyval Blanc grape thrives in the cooler climate of Cayuga Lake - the &quot;middle finger&quot; of the Finger Lakes. A dry white wine that's particularly aromatic and reminiscent of Moscato. Full of white pepper, Meyer lemon, and white flowers. Unoaked and fruit-forward.<br />
#18812<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Lenz Sparkling Cuv&eacute;e (2000)</strong><br />
  Who says you can't make M&eacute;thode Champenoise sparkling wine on the North Fork of Long Island? This current release is drinking very well today. Aromas of green apples and juicy ripe citrus fruit. Fresh and lively on the palate with a nice mineral streak on the finish. Enjoy the fresh fruit today or feel free to hold for a few years to come.<br />
  #10497<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Wolffer Chardonnay Reserve  (2004) </strong><br />
  From the North Fork of Long Island comes this delightful Chardonnay. More Burgundian than New World in style, it shows clean and fresh floral notes. The winemakers have prevented malolactic fermentation, so the acidity is bright and enticing.<br />
  #67102<br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Pellegrini East End Chardonnay     (2005)</strong> <br />
  With 70% fermented in stainless steel tanks, this cool-climate New York Chardonnay has fresh and lovely pear and citrus notes. It&rsquo;s a crisp and refreshing alternative to California Chardonnay.<br />
  #66384<br />
  Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Hosmer Cabernet Franc (2006)  </strong><br />
  The Finger Lakes wine region in upstate New York is home to some fine reds. This Cabernet Franc is a delicious example: full of dark berried fruits - blackberries and blueberries - it finishes with a fresh, lightly tannic finish. Works well with aged cheeses and grilled meats.<br />
  #10201<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Lamoreaux Landing Chardonnay (2005) </strong><br />
  This Chardonnay comes from the cooler climate of the Finger Lakes in upstate New York. It is aged in American oak for less than a year, and quite successfully. Full of fresh apples and vanilla bean on the palate, this is remarkably refreshing and very tasty with white meat dishes.<br />
  #18811<br />
  Sale Price: $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Millbrook Cabernet Franc  (2005) </strong><br />
  Made in the Hudson River Valley from mostly Cabernet Franc, with a little Merlot added for softness and balance. With delicious red and black berry flavors, intriguing spice aromas, and approachable tannins, this is great with anything grilled or roasted - such as beef, lamb, or even something a little more gamey.<br />
  #66644<br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Schneider Cabernet Franc &quot;Le Breton&quot;   (2005) </strong><br />
  Schneider's excellent Cabernet Franc is full of fresh raspberry and red currant fruit aromas. Made in a lighter style, it is meant to be consumed young and shows distinct varietal character.<br />
  #10439<br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Wiemer Semi-Dry Riesling, Finger Lakes (2006) </strong> <br />
  Hermann Wiemer moved to New York from Germany's Mosel region in 1968. This Finger Lakes Riesling, made in the traditional German Sp&auml;tlese style, clearly shows his roots. Notes of baked apples and tangerine fill the palate. <br />
  #17311<br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Channing Daughters, Rosso Fresco (2006) </strong><br />
The wine has a translucent light red color with purple overtones. It is dry, medium-bodied, balanced, and juicy with plum, black cherry, black raspberry, Asian spices, a touch of smoke, and a slight meaty/gamey note.<br />
  #18943<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong> </span><span class="style8">Dr. Konstantin Frank Dry Riesling, Finger Lakes  (2006) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Riesling does very well in the Finger Lakes, and this one is no exception. A beautiful nose of honey and peaches is followed by pear, lemon and minerality on the palate. The fruit and acidity are in perfect balance, and the finish is silky smooth.<br />
