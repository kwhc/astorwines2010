    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Central Italian   Wines</span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Lambrusco Toccacielo, Carafoli </strong></span><strong class="style2"> (NV) </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">This spicy Lambrusco is full of dark berries on the palate. With friendly, approachable fruit, it is a natural match for pizza, cured meats, and cheeses.<br />
#18515</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Chianti Classico Riserva, Cacchiano (2001) </strong><br />
Bottled just this past August, this has an elegant, spiced bouquet, with cherries on the mid-palate and a saline mineral character on the finish. Rich and cellar-worthy..<br />
#14685<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong><strong>Morellino di Scansano, Massi di Mandorlaia    (2003)</strong><br />
This comes from within the strip of Tuscan coastline known as the Maremma. Made from Sangiovese, the dominant red Tuscan grape, this full-bodied red wine is rich in ripe blackberries, spice, and tobacco. This bottle will be a welcome guest at your table whenever rich Italian fare is on the menu.<br />
#18180<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. </strong><strong>Chianti Classico, Saggio(2005)</strong><br />
Saggio Chianti Classico is made from one of the best large producers in all of Tuscany. &quot;Classico&quot; not only describes the character of the wine, but also indicates the zone in which it's produced. This is an ideal match with roasts - especially pork - since its delightful fruit is heavy on the berries.<br />
#19031<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Lill&agrave; (2006)</strong><br />
  This hearty, everyday red wine made from Montepulciano is an easy crowd-pleaser, with tasty aromas of oregano, black olives, blackberries and fern. Solid varietal character comes from estate-owned vines located in the Colline Teramane zone of Abruzzo. Meat on the menu? Pair this wine with a lamb rag&ugrave; served over pasta. If cheese is on your mind, this goes hand in hand with Pecorino, the region&rsquo;s famous sheep&rsquo;s milk cheese.<br />
  #14440<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. </strong><strong>Sagrantino di Montefalco, Cantina dell'Alunno (2005)</strong><br />
Aromas of coffee and dark berries on the nose. On the palate, it is incredibly smooth with firm structure and stunning black fruit aromas. You can't find better Sagrantino at this price.<br />
#12573<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. </strong><strong>Santa Marta, Salustri (2004) </strong><br />
This is a full-bodied Tuscan red wine from the Maremma coastal region. It is a delightful blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that has been aged in oak for 18 months, giving it a spicy component veering in the direction of cinnamon stick.<br />
#18968<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4. Brunello di Montalcino, Talenti   (1999)</strong><br />
  A traditionalist in the land of leisure and experimentation also known as Tuscany. A rich red with dark fruit, firm acidity, and tannins that will allow this wine to age for decades.<br />
  #14684<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. </strong>  <strong>Aglianico &quot;Con Ta Do,&quot; Di Majo Norante (2004)</strong> <br />
This red wine is made from the Aglianico grape and comes from the region of Italy known as Molise - making it quite a rare find in the U.S. The Di Majo family is originally from Naples, but they have settled in quite nicely in Molise, with plenty of indigenous Campanian grape varieties at hand. Here they have achieved a perfectly faithful expression of Aglianico, with rust-red minerality and deep red fruit.<br />
#17987<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. </strong><strong>Trimpilin, Selvagrossa (2005)</strong><br />
&quot;Trimpilin&quot; refers to somebody who is always at the right place at the right time. The Selvagrossa estate (4 ha.) is located in the Pesaro hills along the Adriatic coast in the region of the Marche. The nose on this wine is pure wild cherry and spice; on the palate, it is juicy and makes your mouth water for more.<br />
#18090<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Coenobium, Bianco  (2006)</strong><br />
Nuns probably aren't the first people to come to mind when you think of winemaking, but this white wine was indeed made by a group of nuns in Italy's Lazio region. They did a phenomenal job, too: this dry wine is full of pears, quince, cinnamon, and mineral flavors. Put just a slight chill on it and enjoy.<br />
