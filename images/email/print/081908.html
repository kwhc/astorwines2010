    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Spain    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Jaume Mesquida Negre, Mallorca       (2005) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">This is a Mediterranean wine through and through. Made mostly from Callet, an indigenous Mallorcan grape, this is a rich, concentrated red, with flavors of black cherry, black olive, and toasted vanilla bursting from the glass.<br />
#19611<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Pesquera Tinto Crianza, Ribera del Duero (2004)</strong><br />
  Alejandro Fernandez has worked his magic once again. The Pesquera estate has returned to its former glory: it has been on fire since the historic 2000 vintage, and this bottling may be their best effort yet.<br />
  #19912<br />
  Sale Price: $29.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Juan Gil, Jumilla Red   (2005) </strong><br />
  Made of 100% Monastrell (a.k.a. Mourv&egrave;dre) in the Jumilla region of Spain, the fruit for this wine comes from old vines grown in chalky limestone. A rich, smoky, deep red, this wine pairs perfectly with slow-roasted meats.<br />
  #14393<br />
  Sale Price:   $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Las Brisas Rueda White           (2007)</strong> <br />
  This crisp, fruit-forward white from the Rueda region of central Spain is made from Verdejo, Sauvignon Blanc, and Viura.  Bright citrus notes fill the palate, while flavors of grapefruit and lime linger on the finish. Deliciously refreshing!<br />
  #14358<br />
  Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Vi&ntilde;a Mein, Ribeiro (2005)  </strong><br />
  Vi&ntilde;a Mein comes to us from a tiny DO in northwestern Spain called Ribeiro, which means &quot;riverside&quot; in the Galician language. Many rivers crisscross this area, creating a cool, damp environment that is perfect for making clean, crisp whites. This one pairs quite well with seafood.<br />
  #71981<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Albari&ntilde;o, Mart&iacute;n C&oacute;dax (2007) </strong><br />
  Spain's aromatic white Albari&ntilde;o grape flourishes in the northwestern province of Galicia, and nowhere are the results as impressive as in the R&iacute;as Baixas region. Delightfully crisp, vibrant and floral, this seafood-friendly wine has lively fruit character with a flinty, minerally edge.<br />
  #50824<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Rotllan Torra Reserva, Priorat    (2002) </strong><br />
  This traditional Priorat, produced at a former monastery in northeastern Spain, has strong notes of chocolate, dark plums, violets, and anise. A blend of Grenache, Carignan, and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is simply a great bottle from a very exciting Spanish wine region.<br />
  #12457<br />
  Sale Price:   $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Castillo Labastida Rioja, Reserva  (2001) </strong><br />
  Made from 100% Tempranillo grown on vines that are over 30 years old, this red is a blend of modern expertise and Old World charm. Aged in American barrique for 18 months, it shows warm, toasty vanilla notes blended with black cherry and cloves. Lively acidity makes it excellent with food, and it has a pleasant finish that sticks around forever.<br />
  #18443<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Gravonia Rioja Blanco, Lopez de Heredia (1996) </strong> <br />
  This is the newly released vintage of Lopez de Heredia's &quot;young&quot; white wine. In the flush of youth, it is ready to drink, but of course shows the complexity of the slow, gentle aging process this house is famous for. Practicing Organic..<br />
  #11424<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Ribeira Sacra, Vi&ntilde;a do Burato, D. Ventura  (2007) </strong><br />
The &quot;sacred banks&quot; of the Sil and Mi&ntilde;o rivers, just inland from R&iacute;as Baixas in Galicia, are so steep that they demand careful and laborious hand-harvesting. Ventura's old vines, along with his abhorrence of filtration and chemical yeasts, give this dark-fruited, pulpy wine its succulence.<br />
  #20540<br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Vi&ntilde;a Bosconia Reserva, Lopez de Heredia   (2000) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Coming from the family-run and very traditional Lopez de Heredia estate, this wine has notes of strawberry, blood orange, pomegranate, coconut, and exotic spices. Vi&ntilde;a Bosconia is produced from the juice of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo, and Graciano, aged for three years in American oak barrels. The winery is one of the few in Rioja still owned by its founding family.<br />
