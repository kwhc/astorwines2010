<strong>6.             Amayna, Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda Valley - 2007 </strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Leyda, a sub-region of San  Antonio, is located in a valley between the Coastal Mountain Range and  the Pacific Ocean, running parallel to Chile's Central Valley. This  wine has lots of tropical fruit, dominated by white pineapple and white  flowers. A dry, distinctively New World Sauvignon Blanc.</span> <br />

  <strong>5.   Terra Noble Gran Reserva Carmen&egrave;re - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Carmen&egrave;re grape came to  Chile via Bordeaux in the late nineteenth century, and lately it's been  more at home in South America than France. The red wines made from this  grape can range from refreshing and easy-drinking to full-bodied and  dense. This is one of the brawnier ones, with rich, dark fruit and a  touch of spiciness from oak aging.</span><br />

  <strong>3.     &quot;Neyen&quot; Espiritu de Apalta, Colchagua - 2004 </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Neyen means &quot;spirit&quot; in the native Mapudungun language. The Neyen vineyard was the first in Apalta (Colchagua valley); these Carmen&egrave;re and Cabernet Sauvignon vines were planted in 1890. This red wine is a full-bodied and full of cassis and blackberry spiced fruit.</span><br />
  #19484<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">56.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $48.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.        Echeverria Unwooded Chardonnay - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A Chardonnay unlike any other  in the New World. This is a hand-crafted wine without any trace of oak  influence. Aromas of tropical fruits and pears intermingle with  mouth-watering acidity, while the wine retains a lovely round feel on  the palate. </span> <br />
  #12611<br />
  Original Price: $9.99<br />
Sale Price: $8.49</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>         Amayna, Pinot Noir - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Pinot Noir has come a long way  since it was first planted in Chile, and we were extremely impressed  with the Amayna bottling. Taste it blind and there can be no doubt that  this is pure, delicious Pinot Noir - albeit a bit heftier in style than  most. It's full of wild raspberries, dark cherries, and spice.</span> <br />
