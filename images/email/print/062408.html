    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">SW France &amp; Midi  Wines   </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>VdP C&ocirc;tes de Thau Ros&eacute;, Dom. Gaujal de St. Bon    (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Fresh, dry, and approachable, this ros&eacute; is made by a talented mother-daughter team. You'll love their style; travel to the south of France and you'll find the locals drinking ros&eacute;s just like this one.<br />
#13518<br />
  Sale Price: $7.64</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Picpoul de Pinet &quot;Gaujal de St. Bon,&quot; Gaujalo (2006)</strong><br />
  An exciting and unusual bottling made from the Picpoul Blanc grape in southwest France. Light and dry, this has lemony aromas, raw honey flavors on the palate, and even a nice little kick of mineral on the finish. The Mediterranean climate of this appellation gives its wines plenty of acidity, and this one goes well with a huge range of foods. Intriguing on its own, too.<br />
  #12378<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Minervois, Ch. d'Oupia   (2006) </strong><br />
  An aromatic and densely colored red wine, full-bodied with generous flavors of blackberry and raspberry. Fine tannins, along with accents of pepper and spice, make this an elegant and well-balanced wine.<br />
  #26394<br />
  Sale Price:   $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. VdP Merlot, Dom. de la Patience         (2005)</strong> <br />
  Here we have a stellar example of high-quality Vin de Pays from a great producer. This fruit-forward Merlot from the Languedoc region shows assertive black cherry flavors and a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. It is made without the use of sulfites by a Natural winemaker.<br />
  #15351<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. C&ocirc;tes de Duras, Ch. Haut Lavigne (2007)  </strong><br />
  This light, refreshing white wine, a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and S&eacute;millon, comes from the tiny AOC of C&ocirc;tes de Duras, located directly northeast of Bordeaux. Quince notes, a honeyed nose, and a leesy, mineral-driven palate make this the perfect ap&eacute;ritif wine.<br />
  #17559<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Corbi&egrave;res &quot;L'Enclos,&quot; Dom. des Deux &Acirc;nes (2007) </strong><br />
  Another great endeavor from this husband-and-wife team in the Corbi&egrave;res area of Languedoc. Aged both in tank and in old barrels, this structured red wine comes from a warm vintage, giving it powerful flavors of black fruit, nutmeg, and dried fig.<br />
  #13084<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Juran&ccedil;on Sec Ch. Jolys  (2005) </strong><br />
  This light, dry white comes from Juran&ccedil;on, 30 miles from the Spanish border. With notes of ripe melon, a slight nuttiness, and great acidity, this is the perfect choice with rich shellfish dishes.<br />
  #22664<br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Le Ros&eacute; des Deux &Acirc;nes, Vin de Table    (2007) </strong><br />
  A voluptuous, dry ros&eacute; in a luminous magenta hue. This is from the Corbi&egrave;res region of the Languedoc and is made from a blend of the local grapes: mostly Syrah, Carignan, and Grenache. Full of black and red berry fruits with fresh, bright aromas.<br />
  #20234<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Carignan VdP de Vall&eacute;e du Paradis, Clos des Camuzeilles (2004) </strong> <br />
  rom the Fitou region of the Languedoc, this exceptional wine is made entirely from 70-year-old Carignan vines. Smoky notes on the nose lead to deep plum flavors on the palate.<br />
  #13080<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Muscat Sec, Mas las Cabes, Dom. Gardies  (2006) </strong><br />
The Muscat grape is usually vinified in a sweet style, but Languedoc winemakers excel at making dry versions like this one. Put just a light chill on this bottle and appreciate all it has to offer: we especially liked its delicate aromas of white flowers, fresh limes, and white pepper.<br />
  #12663<br />
  Sale Price: $11.04 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Mas de Daumas Gassac VdP Rouge   (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  From the top estate from the Languedoc, this red is based on Cabernet Sauvignon with an assortment of indigenous red grapes blended in. Subtle aromas of bay leaf, mixed fresh berries, and violets lead to a finish that shows a pleasantly chalky mineral quality. Delicious and absolutely age-worthy, this is at its best when paired with rich foods, especially roasts.<br />
