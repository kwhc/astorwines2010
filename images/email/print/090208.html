<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Trentino-Alto Adige &amp; Friuli </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Pinot Grigio, Friuli Isonzo, Villa Dugo         (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">Friulian Pinot Grigios come in lots of different styles. This one is easy-drinking, very dry, and memorable for its stony mineral character and citrus fruits. Wines from the Isonzo area also tend to be more accessible, as this white ably illustrates.<br />
#20193<br />
  Original Price: $11.98<br />
  Sale Price: $10.18</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. M&uuml;ller-Thurgau &quot;Eisacktaler,&quot; St. Magdalena (2007)</strong><br />
  A cross of Riesling and Silvaner, the white M&uuml;ller-Thurgau grape is more commonly found in Germany, but it also does very well in the high altitudes of the Alto Adige in northern Italy. This is a delicious, fruit-forward, dry white wine with grapefruit and apple aromas.<br />
  #11264<br />
  Original Price: $13.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Schioppettino, Sirch   (2006) </strong><br />
  Producer, Sirch, is intent on showing the delightful qualities of this indigenous red grape variety from the Friuli region of northeast Italy. This is a dry red wine that's unoaked and full of dark berries, violets and even a touch of pepper. Give it a whirl in the decanter and watch it evolve. <br />
  #20158<br />
  Original Price: $19.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Schiava Grigia, Cantina Nalles Magr&egrave;           (2006)</strong> <br />
  A lovely red wine that captures the essence of Schiava. The house style here emphasizes the herbal, mossy, almost sassafras-like character of the grape. Bright, full fruit flavors nonetheless stand out brilliantly against a foundation of gentle notes of damp forest floor. This is great with an herb-roasted chicken, and makes an admirable match for pesto.<br />
  #15092</span><br />
  <span class="style2">Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Pinot Grigio, Elena Walch  (2007)  </strong><br />
  Elena Walch makes some very respectable wines, not the least of whichi is her lovely Pinot Grigio. This is fresh, round in texture, and full of floral and yellow plum fruits on the palate. Dry and delicious.<br />
  #16998<br />
  Original Price: $18.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. M&uuml;ller-Thurgau, Graziano Fontana (2006) </strong><br />
  We were absolutely amazed by the character of this M&uuml;ller-Thurgau, a northern Italian white par excellence. There's lots of lime, white flowers, and a delicious backbone of mineral to complement the fruit. Delightful.<br />
  #12348<br />
  Original Price: $15.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Teroldego Rotaliano, Foradori    (2005) </strong><br />
  Okay, so some grapes were obviously not named by Madison Avenue. But whenever we find a wine as delightful and distinctive as this ripe, blackberry-flavored red, we happily take on any pronunciation-related challenges that may be involved in offering it to our customers.<br />
  #45525<br />
  Original Price: $22.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Lagrein Riserva, Mayr-Nusser  (2004) </strong><br />
  Coming from one of our favorite small producers, this is full of dark berries, leather, smoke, and earth. This wine has exuberant dark-berried fruit character, an elegant texture, and a note of powder on the finish.<br />
  #12930<br />
  Original Price: $28.99<br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Ribolla Gialla, Dorigo (2006) </strong> <br />
  A white wine from the fascinating wine region of Friuli, made from the Ribolla Gialla grape. Floral and exotic, with good acidity to liven the senses, this is delicious with seafood, chicken, and other delicate dishes.<br />
  #10850<br />
  Original Price: $17.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Tazzelenghe, Girolamo Dorigo  (1989) </strong><br />
  The naturally excellent acidity and very strong tannins of this grape have been tamed with a little bottle age. Spicy red fruits make this a gorgeous wine.<br />
  #14833<br />
  Original Price: $36.99<br />
  Sale Price: $31.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Ribolla Gialla &quot;Anfora&quot;, Gravner   (2001) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  This white wine is fermented on the skins for much longer than usual, and then aged in amphorae. There's a near copper tint to the mostly golden hue. On the palate are endlessly changing aromas - ripe pears, white pepper, even melon.<br />
  #12898<br />
  Original Price: $99.99 <br />
