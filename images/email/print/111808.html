  <strong>4. Tokay Pinot Gris &quot;Brand&quot;, Boxler - 2005 (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  For some odd reason, Pinot Gris is referred to as &quot;Tokay Pinot Gris&quot; in Alsace - much to the distress of Hungarians, who cherish an entirely different type of &quot;Tokaji&quot; wine. This dry white comes from the Brand vineyard site, a Grand Cru. It's quite rich, with aromas of red currants, spice, and peaches.<br />
  #19443<br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Pinot Gris is a mutation of Pinot Noir that produces greyish-brown berries and yields round, full-bodied white wines. Try this one the next time you're looking for an alternative to rich, unoaked Chardonnay. Pinot Gris thrives in Alsace, especially in the hands of genius Biodynamic winemaker Marc Kreydenweiss.</span> <br />
  #20662<br />

  <strong>2. Sylvaner &quot;Sono Contento&quot;, A. Seltz - 1996 (750 mL</strong>; you'll find this item in our <strong>Cool Room</strong>)<br />
  The Sylvaner grape renders white wines with an earthy, floral appeal that we've appreciated for years. Add to that the remarkable weather in this vintage and you'll be astounded at how this relatively unknown white grape can perform with age.<br />
  #19947<br />
  Original Price: $47.99<br />
Sale Price: $40.79 </span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   Pinot Blanc &quot;Cuv&eacute;e George&quot;, Ginglinger - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
