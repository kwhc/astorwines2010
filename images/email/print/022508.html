    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Oregon Wines</span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
    <strong>11.   A to Z Chardonnay (2006)</strong><br />
  	This Oregon Chardonnay is produced by the partnership of two winemaking families that founded A to Z in 2001. A to Z is now the fastest-growing winery in the Willamette Valley. The wine was fermented and aged mainly in stainless steel, giving this Chardonnay a bright, crisp character.<br />
  #15879</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Alloro Pinot Noir (2006) </strong><br />
  Especially coming from such a young winery, this is an impressive, advanced bottle of Pinot Noir. Its distinct aroma of musk makes it unlike any Oregon wine we've ever had. This is full of mixed red berry flavors and reminds us of a great Burgundy.<br />
  #18200</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Pinot Noir &quot;Cuv&eacute;e A&quot;, Anne Amie (2005)</strong> <br />
  Cuv&eacute;e A is a classic Oregon Pinot Noir. The bouquet is filled with aromas of spices, fresh black raspberries, and hints of toast. On the palate, you'll find cranberries and ripe black cherries, with accents of sage and cinnamon. The finish is lively and long, with a clean freshness that invites another sip. Excellent with seafood, such as salmon or halibut..<br />
  #18333<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Sokol Blosser, Evolution No.9 (NV)</strong><br />
  A complex yet easy-drinking blend of nine white grape varieties. Each brings its own style to the table, but they all end up working together to form a well-integrated and approachable whole.<br />
  #65495<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Ransom &quot;Junehog,&quot; Oregon (2006)</strong><br />
  Fascinatingly aromatic yet admirably poised and restrained, this idiosyncratic blend of M&uuml;ller-Thurgau, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, and Riesling will startle you - but it'll do it quietly. Bits of the bouquet call to mind a nice big Chardonnay (which seems to be the one white grape that isn't in this blend), yet there are innumerable exotic aromas and flavors flitting around a solid core of firm acidity. This is a must-try: aside from being delicious, it's completely unlike anything we've ever had.<br />
  #18648<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Elvenglade Pinot Blanc, Yamhill County (2006)</strong><br />
  Reminiscent of an Alsatian Pinot Blanc but much fresher, with lively acidity on the palate. A rich and floral white wine with an abundance of honey fruit on the finish.<br />
  #13389<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. King Estate &quot;Signature Collection&quot; Pinot Gris (2006)</strong><br />
  A dry Pinot Gris (a.k.a. Pinot Grigio) that's full of flowers and citrus fruit on the palate. This is surprisingly rich, both in body and texture.<br />
  #17894<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4. Penner-Ash Viognier (2006)</strong><br />
  A wonderful dry white wine with subtle fruit and floral flavors: citrus and pear take center stage, but a subtle minerality is present as well. The wine is unoaked and aged on the lees for 5 months before bottling.<br />
  #19436<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Ken Wright Cellars Pinot Noir, Canary Hill Vineyard   (2006)</strong><br />
  The Canary Hill vineyard is located at the southern end of the Eola Hills, which are covered with southeast-facing vines. This wine shows good complexity and concentration, with intense flavors of red currant, cola, and cranberry.<br />
  #10443  
  <br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. De Lancellotti, Pinot Noir (2005) </strong><br />
  De Lancellotti Family Vineyards Pinot Noir is produced from estate-grown fruit from their 15-acre vineyard, nestled on top of a hill with exquisite exposure in the Chehalem Mountain AVA.<br />
  #19485<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. Pinot Noir &quot;Beacon Hill,&quot; Soter Vineyards</strong></span><strong class="style2"> (2005) </strong><br />  
        <span class="style2">Dark and brooding berry fruit with warm spices and toasty oak aromas. Nutty truffle notes add a little intrigue to this cellar-worthy Pinot Noir.<br />
  #18392</span></p>
