  Sak&eacute;s can be divided into two groups &ndash; those made only from  water, rice, and koji (a type of mold that acts as a fermenting agent), and those to  which a small amount of brewer&rsquo;s alcohol is added after the fermentation. The  former is called Junmai, or &ldquo;pure rice sak&eacute;,&rdquo; and the fortified type is called Honjozo.  If the label does not explicitly state that a sak&eacute; is Junmai, then it can be  assumed to be Honjozo.</p>
<p>For straight Junmai or Honjozo sak&eacute;s, the grains of rice  have been polished down to 70% or less of their original mass. The next level  of polishing is <strong>Ginjo</strong>, for which the  grains are polished down to 60% or less. The highest degree of polishing is  termed <strong>Daiginjo</strong>, and at this level  the grains of rice have been polished down to a meager 50% or less of their original  mass. </p>
<p>To confuse the matter slightly: The polishing grade has  nothing to do with whether or not any brewer&rsquo;s alcohol has been added to the  sak&eacute;. Thus, for pure sak&eacute;s to which no alcohol has been added, &ldquo;Junmai&rdquo; is used  as a prefix: e.g. Junmai Ginjo and Junmai Daiginjo. If alcohol has been added,  the sak&eacute;s will simply be labeled as Ginjo or Daiginjo. </p>
<p>While there is indeed a direct correlation between the level  of polishing and the relative price of a sak&eacute;, that&rsquo;s not to say that Junmai  Daiginjo sak&eacute;s are necessarily &ldquo;better&rdquo; than simple Junmai sak&eacute;s. Nonetheless,  the more highly polished the grains of rice are, the cleaner and more refined  the resultant flavors and aromas will be. So, if you prefer sak&eacute;s that are  light, delicate, and fruity, then you may indeed want to shell out for some of  the more expensive Ginjo and Daiginjo styles. If, however, you prefer sak&eacute;s  that are more robust and earthy, you may find that the Junmai and Honjozo  styles suit your palate better.</p>
<p>An important note: <strong>If  you want to serve your sak&eacute; warm, stick to the Junmai and Honjozo styles.</strong> Ginjo and Daiginjo sak&eacute;s are too delicate to withstand the heat.</p>
<p>The classification of sak&eacute;s doesn&rsquo;t end with their polishing  grade: there are several further discriminating terms that can be applied to  any sak&eacute;, at any level of polishing. Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of the most  common lingo: </p>
<p><strong>Genshu</strong> sak&eacute;s are  undiluted &ndash; i.e., &ldquo;cask strength&rdquo; or &ldquo;barrel strength.&rdquo; (And yes, to answer  your raising eyebrows, most sak&eacute;s are indeed diluted with water prior to  bottling.) As you might imagine, Genshu sak&eacute;s tend to offer much sharper and  more pronounced flavors.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Koshu</strong> (or <strong>Jukushu</strong>) sak&eacute;s are aged. These sak&eacute;s  generally take on a golden amber hue, and often develop complex aromas of nuts  and smoke. </p>
<p><strong>Nama</strong> sak&eacute;s are  unpasteurized and are often released seasonally. These tend to be particularly  delicate and must be kept refrigerated at all times. They generally offer very  subtle fruity aromas. </p>
<p><strong>Nigori</strong> sak&eacute;s are  the cloudy-looking ones on the shelf: they do not undergo the traditional  filtration process. These sak&eacute;s range from dry to sweet, and generally possess  a creamy texture and lots of fruit on the palate. Nigori sak&eacute;s should be gently  tipped upside down in the bottle a few times prior to serving.</p>
<p><strong>Shizuku</strong> is  &ldquo;trickle&rdquo; or &ldquo;free-run&rdquo; sak&eacute;. It tends to be extremely delicate and, as one  might expect, quite pricey. </p>
<p><strong>Tokubetsu</strong> means  &ldquo;special,&rdquo; and indicates the use of more highly polished rice than would  typically be denoted by the polishing grade, or the use of &ldquo;very special&rdquo; sak&eacute;  rice.</p>
