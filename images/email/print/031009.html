  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">       Gavi, C&agrave; Adua - 2007</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">There are some insipid bottles of Gavi out there, but this isn't one of them: the C&agrave; Adua is the type of white wine we get excited about. The nose offers pure and precise aromas of yellow fruit, oregano, fresh herbs, and wet stones. On the palate the fruit is rich, satisfying, and intense. An absolute treat that we were delighted to find.</span> <br />
#21091<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$12.74<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.      Brachetto d'Acqui &quot;Rebecca&quot;, Nuova Abbazia di Vallechiara - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A dessert wine that's just  slightly sweet on the palate. The color is a show-stopping, luminescent  cherry red. The fruit is all raspberries and mixed wild berries, and it  finishes with a mineral edge. A bit of light carbonation only adds to  this wine's appeal.</span> <br />
  #19627<br />
  Original Price: $18.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>        Pelaverga, Vigna di Terre Rosse - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is a beautiful, bright  crimson-colored wine made from the rare Pelaverga grape. It is shy upon  opening, but within a couple of hours begins to show fresh cranberry  fruit with vivid aromas of flowers, spice, clay, and powder. Delicately  textured with a subtle iron minerality on the finish. Just another  humble yet amazing Piedmontese wine, well worthy of a patient taster's  attention. This comes from the Saluzzo area (southwest of Turin), which  is known as the original home of Pelaverga.</span> <br />
  #13001<br />
Original Price: $22.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $19.54<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.     Barbera d'Alba &quot;Sori del Drago&quot;, Brovia - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Medium-bodied with voluptuous  plum fruit. As is so typical of Barbera, this is dangerously easy-drinking.  A bottle for those who crave a red with substance without a highly  tannic backbone.</span> <br />
  #46999<br />
  Original Price: $24.99<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.      Barolo &quot;Villero&quot;, Brovia - 2000</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Villero is a heavier,  denser Barolo from Brovia that is nicely nuanced. It has a fine  minerality, along with delicate aromas of roses, red berries, and  hazelnuts. All in all a very impressive Nebbiolo.</span> <br />
#10953<br />
Original Price: $64.99 <br />
Sale Price: $55.24<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.         Dogliani &quot;Papa Celso&quot;, Abbona - 2006</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is the Abbona family's  &quot;tre bicchieri&quot;-winning Dolcetto, produced from older vines. It is the  pride of their estate, showing lovely, bright red fruit, elegance, and  the classic soft femininity of Dolcetto.</span> <br />
  #10381<br />
  Original Price: $26.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $22.94<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.   Erbaluce &quot;Cariola,&quot; Ferrando - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The &quot;Cariola&quot; is a  medium-bodied, fragrant, still white wine from Caluso in northern  Piedmont. Made from Erbaluce, an indigenous white grape variety, this  has ripe, white floral aromas that lead to a very lovely mineral finish.</span> <br />
  #10417<br />
  Original Price: $23.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $20.39<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.        Grignolino, Cascina Tavijn - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Grignolino is a rare red Italian grape, and it's simply a fun wine to drink with food. This bottle has loads of red cherry fruit to it. It's dry, pale red in color, and works wonders with antipasti.</span> <br />
  #12401<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Timorasso &quot;Sassobraglia&quot;, Fontanassa, Val Borbera - 2007 </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Timorasso grape is a specialty of southern Piedmont. This one comes from the Valley of Borbera, which separates Piedmont from Liguria. The wine has lovely, bright acidity and delightful pear skin notes on the nose.</span> <br />
  #21092<br />
  Original Price: $22.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.      Monferrato Dolcetto &quot;Nibio&quot;, Cascina degli Ulivi - 2005</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">&quot;Nibio&quot; is an ancient name for Dolcetto and hearkens back to a time when the grape was widely planted around Gavi (those vineyards are now dedicated to the Cortese variety). This dark, earthy, and mineral-laden rendition of Dolcetto offers a fresh look at a grape known for its ebullient fruitiness. This 16-hectare estate is not only Biodynamic but also self-sustaining, in the sense that they raise everything from chickens to the yeasts they use in fermentation. Their wines are weirdly beautiful, compelling, and entirely worth experimenting with. The Dolcetto comes from the so-called &quot;Terre Rosse&quot;: red, iron-rich soils that impart a distinctive mineral character to this wine.</span><br />
  #21389<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
Sale Price: $14.44</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>      &quot;Montemarino&quot; VdT, Cascina degli Ulivi - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Made from 120-year-old Cortese vines, this is arguably the best Gavi-style wine you'll ever have. The nose gives up dense white fruit and floral aromas, while the palate is rich and packed with ripe, succulent flavors. A bottle not to be missed.</span> <br />
#21350<br />
