  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">When you're looking to go back  to basics in Tuscany, stick with classic estates like this one. This  bottle is just coming around but could truly be held for well over a  decade longer. Full of aromas of black cherries, blackberries, violets,  clay, and thyme. Made from old Sangiovese vines that have since been  replanted. Only time will tell if Il Sodaccio will ever be made again.</span> <br />

It drinks well today with decanting,  but will certainly evolve and improve with age. This is aged in 50% new  barrique, but the oak is unobtrusive on the palate.</span> <br />
