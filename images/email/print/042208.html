    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">California's 'Other Red' Wines </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>St Francis Red, Sonoma County (2004) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Made from grapes sourced from the esteemed Sonoma Valley region, this is an extraordinary blend of Zinfandel, Grenache, Merlot, and Sangiovese. Spicy, dark fruit and lively tannins will awaken your palate as you match this up with grilled meats and barbecue fare.<br />
#13874<br />
  Sale Price: $9.34</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Edmunds St. John Rocks and Gravel (2005)</strong><br />
  This wine's a bit on the wild side. A blend of red Rh&ocirc;ne grape varieties, it sings with flavors of baked plum, dried cherry, white pepper, a bit of licorice, and some floral notes. Lovingly made from Paso Robles fruit.<br />
  #11071<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Bonny Doon Sangiovese  (2005) </strong><br />
  One of the best California Sangioveses we've tasted, this deep, smooth red can match up with the best of its Tuscan brethren. It's full-bodied, but retains the excellent acidity that makes Sangiovese great with rich meats.<br />
  #60045<br />
  Sale Price:   $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Qup&eacute; Syrah, Central Coast  (2005)</strong> <br />
  A tasty and aromatic Syrah from Rh&ocirc;ne-grape specialist Qup&eacute;. This medium-bodied wine boasts classic Syrah flavors: black fruit and a touch of black pepper.<br />
  #87624<br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Eberle Sangiovese (2005)  </strong><br />
  Sangiovese is the red grape variety that Tuscany made famous. On California soil, it shows its Italian roots with racy acidity and crisp tannins, beautifully supported by violet-tinged cherry fruit and finishing with a flourish of almond skin. This is truly among the finest bottles of Sangiovese to come out of California.<br />
  #18452<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Thomas Coyne Mourv&egrave;dre (2004) </strong><br />
  Thomas Coyne winery, located in the South Livermore area of California, was started in 1989.  Using grapes from Mourv&egrave;dre vines that were planted in 1919, this wine is a perfect example of the varietal done the right way. Pure, clean fruit with lively dark berry and rich concentration.<br />
  #19606<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Lioco Red Blend, &quot;Indica&quot; (2006) </strong><br />
  Lioco has created this Mediterranean-style blend from old-vine Carignane and a touch of Petit Verdot. This is a medium-bodied wine, with bright red fruit and great freshness that make it perfect for everyday drinking.<br />
  #19593<br />
  Sale Price:   $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. McManis Family Syrah, River Junction   (2006) </strong><br />
  Soft and fleshy, with ripe tannins, complex flavors of blackberry and cherry, and just a touch of cedar and smoke. This screams for black pepper-crusted pork loin.<br />
  #10990<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.Tensley &quot;Colson Canyon&quot; Syrah (2006) </strong> <br />
  With a background making wine at Babcock and Beckman, Joey Tensley started making Tensley wines in 1998. This single-vineyard Syrah comes from the Colson Canyon vineyard, located on a hillside in Santa Barbara County. Dark fruit notes, spice, and vanilla combine to create a rich, sultry Syrah. Only a minuscule quantity of this wine is made. <br />
  #14156<br />
  Sale Price: $30.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Castle Rock Petite Sirah, California (2005) </strong><br />
A medium-bodied Petite Sirah featuring dark berry fruits and black pepper, gently supported by spicy oak. The typically aggressive tannins of Petite Sirah are incredibly well managed here, yielding a bright and smooth expression of this California variety.<br />
  #15415<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong> </span><span class="style8">Saxon Brown Syrah, Parmalee Hill  (2004) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  This wine is still youthful and offers up rich and peppery notes of grapey fruit. Roasted meat, coffee, graphite, and smoky nuances hint at the flavor transformation that will come with age. Soft and rich in the mouth, with bright acidity supporting red fruits that echo the roasted note from the nose.<br />
  #17217<br />
