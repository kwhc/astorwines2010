    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Austria    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner &quot;Senftenberger Piri&quot;, Nigl     (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Grown in primary rock on the Nigls' hilltop Seftenberger Piri vineyard, this is a well-structured, complex Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner that is more masculine in style. Their creation is forward now, yet full of nuance.<br />
#58101<br />
  Sale Price: $20.39</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. St. Laurent, Weingut Meinhard Forstreiter (2004)</strong><br />
  Coming from 50-year-old vines, this is typical of the terroir: it shows ripe fruit, fine structure, and great balance, along with juicy, spicy flavors of sour cherries and chocolate.<br />
  #13574<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Heinrich Red   (2005) </strong><br />
  A well-structured, approachable, and straightforwardly named bottling from one of Austria's top producers of red wine. Full, ripe fruit and soft tannins make this blend (of Zweigelt and Blaufr&auml;nkisch) a great match for a wide array of meat dishes.<br />
  #98876<br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Zweigelt Classic, Iby          (2006)</strong> <br />
  Anton Iby only makes red wines in the Burganland of Austria. His Zweigelt Classic shows gorgeous red cherry fruit and soft tannins. As the name says, this is a very traditional example of a great Zweigelt.<br />
  #19500<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner &quot;Vesper&quot;, Setzer (2006)  </strong><br />
  From the up-and-coming Weinvertel region in eastern Austria comes this introductory offer from Setzer. His &quot;Vesper&quot; Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner is grown at a high altitude and shows remarkable floral notes, including linden and violets. This is complex white with richly layered flavors and a lasting finish..<br />
  #14330<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Blaufr&auml;nkish &quot;A'kira&quot;, Tement (2005) </strong><br />
  A'kira is a project that began a few vintages back between FX Pichler and Manfred Tement.  This intense red shows immense black pepper spice, black currant aromas, and satin tannins.<br />
  #19287<br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Zweigelt &quot;Rubin Carnuntum&quot; Glatzer (2006) </strong><br />
  This &quot;sweetheart&quot; of a Zweigelt (according to importer Terry Theise) offers a pretty array of red plum and cherry flavors on the nose. Sweet fruit and hints of cinnamon on the palate make the wine easily likeable without food, though we certainly wouldn't turn down a roast duck to go with it.<br />
  #14272<br />
  Sale Price:   $17.84<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner &quot;Tradition&quot;, Schloss Gobelsburg (2005) </strong><br />
  Schloss Gobelsburg has created this Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner as homage to the wines of 50 years ago; they feel that this style is quickly disappearing from the modern wine world. Intriguing notes of pipe smoke, white pepper, and fresh coconut milk mingle with a forest-floor earthiness.<br />
  #16851<br />
  Sale Price: $33.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Riesling &quot;Gobelsburger&quot;, Schloss Gobelsburg (2007) </strong> <br />
  With notes of green tea, verbena, pear, lime-blossom, and wisteria, this is an absolute masterpiece from the Schloss Gobelsburg estate. A gorgeous, structured, and focused Riesling.<br />
  #15553<br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Roter Veltliner &quot;Scheiben&quot;, Leth  (2005) </strong><br />
This white wine has terrific concentration, with floral and white pepper notes. Made from Roter Veltliner vines that are about 40 years old, the finished wine is rich and viscous with a lasting finish. The winemakers have taken full advantage of the phenomenal quality of the Scheiben vineyard.<br />
  #19501<br />
  Sale Price: $24.64 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Riesling &quot;Loibenberg&quot; Smaragd, Alzinger   (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Alzinger is one of the top producers in the Wachau, making pure and focused Rieslings. The Loibenberg bottling is packed with mineral, with notes of honeysuckle that evoke the first days of spring.<br />
