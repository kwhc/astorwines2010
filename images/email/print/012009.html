  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A juicy, tasty red from  Robertson, South Africa. It shows loads of dark fruit on the palate  with cassis and a touch of smoke on the finish.

  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>   Solms Wijn de Caab &quot;Lekkerwijn&quot; Ros&eacute; - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Solms winery is located in  the Franschhoek Valley, an area with a Mediterranean climate where  Rh&ocirc;ne grape varieties thrive. Barrel-aged and made from Grenache,  Mourv&egrave;dre, and Viognier, this wine belongs in the &quot;serious ros&eacute;&quot;  category: it delivers nuanced complexity that rewards attentive sipping.</span><br />
  #19830<br />
  Original Price: $19.99 <br />

  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.  De Wetshof Estate &quot;Lesca&quot; Chardonnay - 2007  (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A delicious white wine that is  lightly oaked for 3 months; the wood shows up on the palate as a fresh  undertone of vanilla bean. With its abundant floral apple fruit, you'd  never mistake this for anything but a great Chardonnay. It's drinking  well today but could certainly hold for a few years to come.</span> <br />
  #16617<br />
  Original Price: $21.99<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.   The William, Graham Beck - 2003 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A delicious and complex blend of Pinotage and Cabernet Sauvignon. This dark red shows lots of spicy oak and cassis on the nose and palate.</span> <br />
#15193<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.      Cape Indaba Chenin Blanc - 2007 (750 mL)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">One of Astor's best white wine  values, this Chenin Blanc has tantalizing aromas of ripe pears and  flowers, with exuberant tropical fruit on the palate. This is great  with cheeses, fish, and light pasta dishes.</span> <br />
  #70010<br />
  Original Price: $5.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $5.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.  Hamilton Russell Pinot Noir - 2007 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Hamilton Russell Vineyards  concentrates on only two grape varieties - Chardonnay and Pinot Noir -  because they believe these are best suited for the terroir of Walker  Bay, South Africa. It's ruby in color, with aromas of cherries and warm  &ldquo;winter&rdquo; spices like vanilla and cinnamon.</span> <br />
  #11043<br />
  Original Price: $36.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $31.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.     Sauvignon Blanc, Buitenverwachting - 2007 (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">We won't even attempt to sound  the name out phonetically, but we will tell you its translation:  &quot;beyond expectation.&quot; We found that very apt when we tried this wine.  Made partly from vine plantings that are over 80 years old, with some  younger ones mixed in as well, it has notes of crisp fresh flowers,  peppers and minerals. Still fresh and young, this will evolve  wonderfully with a bit of bottle age. From Constantia, a cooler-climate  ward of the coastal region of South Africa.</span> <br />
  #14547<br />
  Original Price: $14.99<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.    Brampton Shiraz - 2006 (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A solid Shiraz from South Africa. The Brampton line of wines from the Stellenbosch region are made in a style that boasts upfront fruit on the palate. This is unoaked and shows all the red, peppery fruit you've come to love in this versatile grape.</span> <br />
  #14014<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Pinotage, Graham Beck - 2008 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here's a wonderful introduction to the world of Pinotage - or a great way to continue your exploration if you're already familiar with the variety. Pinotage is a unique South African hybrid of Cinsault and Pinot Noir that is medium-bodied and easy-drinking.</span> <br />
  #20885<br />
  Original Price: $12.99<br />
Sale Price: $11.04</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>  Mulderbosch Sauvignon Blanc, Stellenbosch - 2007 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">An absolutely beautiful, world-class Sauvignon Blanc. It's very crisp with layers of delicious ripe melon and mineral flavors. Serve with a simple fish dish and let this wine shine.</span> <br />
