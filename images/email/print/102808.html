Koshu sak&eacute; is aged sak&eacute;. This one has been aged for 8 years before releasing for sale. This aging has a remarkable effect on the aromas. Full of mixed, toasted nuts with a touch of dried fruit and even a little soy.<br />

  <strong>9. Tsukinokatsura &quot;Hiyaoroshi&quot; Sak&eacute;, Junmai Nama </strong><br />
  The Tsukinokatsura brewery was the first to brew a nigori sak&eacute;, and the first to age in ceramic casks. Now they're offering this fall-release sak&eacute;, and although it isn't their first, it's probably your first experience with a rich, seasonal brew like this one.<br />

  Released once a year in the fall (that's what &quot;Hiyaoroshi&quot; refers to), this is made for immediate consumption. Dry, smooth, and as fresh as well water, with a clean, dry finish. From Shizuoka in Japan and from one of the finest sak&eacute; producers around.<br />

  <strong>7. Dewazakura Sak&eacute;, Daiginjo</strong> <br />
Rich and full of pineapple aromas, this drinks well as an ap&eacute;ritif or alongside rich, meaty fish dishes like halibut. The bottle sports a detail that is quite rare for a sak&eacute;: the brewer has chosen to list its vintage, indicating when the rice was harvested.<br />

  <strong>4. Kokuryu &quot;500 Mangoku&quot; Sak&eacute;, Junmai Ginjo</strong><br />
  This is quite a dry sak&eacute;, with a very earth-driven profile that you'll enjoy if you're looking for complexity rather than simple, clean fruit flavors.
