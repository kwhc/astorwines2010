    <span class="style2"><span class="style9">Wines of New Zealand </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.</strong></span><span class="style2"><strong> Martinborough Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc          (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">This is simply not what springs to mind when we think of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc! Its finty aromas are reminiscent of Pouilly-Fuiss&eacute;; it shows beautiful Meyer lemon ripeness on the mid-palate; and salinity shines through on the finish. <br />

  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Gravitas, Pinot Noir (2006)</strong><br />
  This comes from a family-owned estate in Marlborough. The winery has been around since the early 1990s, and they've learned a few things about making fantastic Pinot Noir. This is a complicated m&eacute;lange of spices, raspberries, cherries, and even a bit of game. It spends 10 months in oak and already carries itself with considerable elegance.<br />
  #19818<br />
  Original Price: $27.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $23.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Sileni Sauvignon Blanc     (2007) </strong><br />
  This New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc offers everything we look for in a fresh white from this neck of the woods. It is lightly herbaceous, with upfront gooseberry fruit, juicy acidity, and perfect ripeness. While this is a dry wine, it is absolutely packed to the brim with fruit.<br />
  #12522<br />
  Original Price: $14.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Huia Sauvignon Blanc           (2007)</strong> <br />
  Gooseberry, tropical fruit, and lime notes abound in this textbook New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. A classic wine calls for a classic pairing, so try it with shellfish for a phenomenal experience.<br />

  <strong>7. Craggy Range &quot;Sophia&quot; Gimblett Gravels  (2004)  </strong><br />
  Very Bordelais in style, with an additional dose of dark berried fruits on the palate. Elegant yet full-bodied and certainly a wine you can cellar for years.<br />

  <br />
  <strong>5. Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc     (2007) </strong><br />

  <strong>4. Seresin Chardonnay  (2005) </strong><br />
  These Chardonnay grapes are hand-harvested and vinified using natural yeasts. The winery uses 20% new oak and ages for thirteen months in barrel. The resulting wine is both smoky and citrus-laden, with lots of ripe fruit on the nose and palate. It's the kind of wine to have with hearty chicken and pork dishes.<br />

  The Wairau Valley in Marlborough is New Zealand's original and most famous area for Sauvignon Blanc. The Wellies bottling is incredibly approachable, and this new vintage has just arrived on our shelves here at Astor. The nose is full of gooseberries, fresh herbs and melon. An incredibly fresh, dry white wine to suit any number of occasions.<br />
