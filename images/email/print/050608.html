This bottling from Benson Ferry is the product of three generations of winemaking in the Stokes Family. This juicy red wine is all about blackberries and blueberries, with a subtle nuance of cedar and mint from a moderate six months of oak aging.<br />

  <strong>3. Ridge Zinfandel Lytton Springs (2005) </strong> <br />
  From winemaker Paul Draper comes a truly iconic Zinfandel.  For several decades, the Lytton Springs vineyard in Sonoma County has been the source for these well-balanced, pure, and age-worthy bottlings.  While rambunctious in their youth, a few years of cellaring brings out layers of flavors and an elegant quality very rarely found in California Zinfandel.  <br />
  #63264<br />
  Sale Price: $28.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Nalle Zinfandel, Dry Creek Valley (2005) </strong><br />
Lovely raspberry aromas and dry, earthy aromatics greet the nose, along with a moderate dose of oak. This medium-bodied Zin shows good acidity and tannins that are supportive yet unobtrusive. It has succulent, intense strawberry fruit on the palate, and a finish that is a touch compressed at the moment. Lingering earth and light toast notes frame the brambly fruit. This is an exceptionally civilized California Zinfandel.<br />

  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong> </span><span class="style8">Saxon Brown Zinfandel, Casa Santinamaria  (2003) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  This offers up an incredibly expressive nose, with loads of cedary spice, grape leaf, and tobacco, leading to jammy fruit and a hint of milk chocolate with an earthy underlay. The wine shows an elegantly restrained palate impression for such a warm vintage.<br />
