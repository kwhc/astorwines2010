    <span class="style2"><span class="style9">Greek Wines </span> <br />
    (... our lists go up to 11)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8"> Santorini, Hatzidakis - 2007 </span><span class="style2"><strong>(750 mL)</strong> <br />
The most interesting thing about the Assyrtiko that grows on Santorini, aside from the wines it produces, is that the vines are trained in spiral formations. This makes them resemble baskets, and protects the grapes against the island's incredible heat. Citrusy, minerally, and made to accompany grilled octopus, this is richer and riper than many Santorini whites, but its acidity and piercing minerality are pronounced enough to tame the wine's fullness.<br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Samos, an Aegean island off the coast of Turkey, produces this golden, viscous Muscat.  It has a nose of sweet pears, peaches and nuts that continue through the lingering, honeyed finish.</span> <br />

  <strong>8.  Retsina, Gaia - NV (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Not your yiayia's Retsina. Gaia has produced an exquisite version of this traditional wine by seeping &ldquo;tea bags&rdquo; of pine resin in the must, which creates subtle aromas of mint and eucalyptus. A must-try with salty foods!</span><br />

  <br />
  <strong>7. Robola, Gentilini - 2007 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span>Located on the island of Cephalonia in the Ionian Sea, the Gentilini winery has been making wines since the early 1980s. Robola is a native variety from this region, creating a white that is fresh and light, with citrus, floral, and almond notes. A great mineral finish, too!<br />

Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6. Agioritiko &quot;Red on Black&quot; Mitravelas - 2006 (750 mL)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Many Greek wines strike us as a tad out of the ordinary - and we love out of the ordinary! Fluffy, dark raspberry flavors carry through the nose to the palate lending a pretty element to a medium-bodied, meaty, earthy wine. This bottle will not disappoint.</span> <br />

  <br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Notios Red, Gaia - 2007 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Notios means &quot;the southerner,&quot; and this easy-drinking red is indeed from southern Greece. It is made from the local Agiorgitiko variety, which in this case has yielded a soft, velvety wine with plum and cherry flavors.</span><br />
  #15310<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Mantinia, Dom. Spiropoulos - 2007 (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  This dry white is produced from the indigenous Moschofilero grape, grown at an altitude of 650 meters. Similar in style to Muscat, this has a floral bouquet and citrus flavors on the palate. Clean and crisp.<br />

  <br />
  <strong>3.  St. John Commandaria Cyprus, Keo - NV (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This traditional dessert wine is considered to be the oldest named wine still in production. Grapes that are indigenous to the island of Cyprus are picked late and dried on mats, in order to obtain maximum concentration and sweetness. Produced by the Solera system, this is a nutty wine with aromas of cocoa and baking spices.</span> <br />
  #53994<br />
  Original Price: $17.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Thimiopoulos &quot;Uranos&quot; Xinomavro, Naoussa - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  Some say Xynomavro is the father of the Pinot Noir grape.  Others say it is related to Nebbiolo.  This Greek indigenous grape excels in the northern reaches of Macedonia.  Spicy and crystalline, with black cherry notes. Delicious!<br />
  #19748<br />
  Original Price: $23.99<br />
