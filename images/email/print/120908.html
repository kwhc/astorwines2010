  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">   Minervois, Ch. d'Oupia - 2006 (750<strong> mL)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
An aromatic and densely colored red wine, full-bodied with generous blackberry and raspberry flavors. Fine tannins, along with accents of pepper and spice, make this an elegant and well-balanced wine.<br />
#26394<br />
Original Price: $11.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$10.19<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Bandol Rouge, Domaine Tempier - 2006 (750 mL) </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This beautiful Proven&ccedil;al offering is reminiscent of sun-ripened dark fruit and the spice of garrigue. The wine is 75% Mourv&egrave;dre, blended with Grenache, Cinsault, and Carignan. Though a touch austere in its youth, this will flesh out beautifully over the next couple years. Drink it with wild boar.</span> <br />
  #11902<br />
  Original Price: $39.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $33.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>C&ocirc;tes de Provence &quot;Escapade&quot;, Comptoirs de Magdala - 2006 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Antoine Pouponneau, winemaker of Tour du Bon Bandol, has created this brilliant C&ocirc;tes de Provence. It's full of bright red fruit and balanced acidity.</span> <br />
  #16570<br />
  Original Price: $17.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $15.29<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.   C&ocirc;te de Provence &quot;Cuv&eacute;e Carolle&quot; Dom de la Sauveuse - 2006 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A hearty red blend - Cabernet, Grenache, Syrah, and Mourv&egrave;dre - from the south of France. This is full of earthy dark berries and a touch of peppermint from oak aging. Excellent with hard cheeses and cured meats.</span><br />
  #20359<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.  Muscat Sec, Mas las Cabes, Dom. Gardies - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span>While the Muscat grape is often vinified in a sweet style, Languedoc winemakers excel at making dry versions like this one. Put just a light chill on this bottle and appreciate all it has to offer: we especially liked its delicate bouquet of white flowers, fresh limes, and white pepper.<br />
#12663<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.  Picpoul de Pinet &quot;Gaujal de St. Bon,&quot; Gaujal - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">An exciting and unusual white wine made in southwest France from the Picpoul Blanc grape. Light and dry, this has lemony aromas, raw honey flavors on the palate, and even a nice little kick of mineral on the finish. The Mediterranean climate of this appellation gives its wines plenty of acidity, and this one goes well with a huge range of foods. It's tasty on its own, too.</span> <br />
  #12378<br />
  Original Price: $10.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Pichon Viognier - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This red wine is made from the Gamay grape variety. On the nose you'll find hints of black pepper, followed by ample fresh cherry fruit on the palate.</span><br />
  #13806<br />
  Original Price: $11.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.   Minervois &quot;La M&egrave;re Grand&quot;, Le Loup Blanc - 2004 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong> <br />
  If you've ever been curious about what Viognier can be, try this rich, round white wine. Thrilling aromas of peaches and pears, along with a long, smooth finish, make this a revelation - especially if you are unacquainted with this grape. Perfect with poultry.<br />
  #18122<br />
  Original Price: $23.99<br />
  Sale Price: $20.39<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.   Pic Saint-Loup &quot;Les Tonilli&egrave;res,&quot; Mas Foulaquier - 2005 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Pic Saint-Loup comes from southern France's Coteaux du Languedoc region. It&rsquo;s a full-bodied, unoaked, dry red blend that bursts with mixed dark fruit aromas.</span> <br />
  #18279<br />
  Original Price: $18.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.   VdP de Vaucluse, Dom. de Fenouillet - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  This tasty red wine is from the southern borders of the Rh&ocirc;ne Valley, more specifically known as the Vaucluse. This based on the Marcelan grape (a cross between Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon), with Merlot and Alicante Bouschet. Naturally, there's a bit of spice on the palate and lots of mixed dark fruit.<br />
  #15777<br />
  Original Price: $8.99<br />
Sale Price: $7.64</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   Costi&egrave;res de N&icirc;mes &quot;Marginal&quot;, Terre des Chardons - 2006 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
A delicious, concentrated red wine that's left unoaked in order to emphasize the character of the grapes. This is a new arrival at Astor, and we couldn't be more pleased with the quality of this voluptuous wine. It's very pure, with lots of dark fruits (currants, black cherries, blackberries) and floral spices on the finish. Feel free to decant this for half an hour before drinking.<br />
