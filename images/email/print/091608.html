    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Manta Sauvignon Blanc          (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">A light, easy-drinking wine made even brighter by fresh melon and lemon zest flavors. This is a purely refreshing white wine that is a hit at parties, so consider picking up a case.<br />
#12655<br />
  Original Price: $6.99<br />
  Sale Price: $5.94</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Concha y Toro, Casillero del Diablo, Cab. Sauvignon (2007)</strong><br />
  This wine starts off with a good amount of wood, but then rounds out into a nicely ripe, well-balanced, fruity finish that is uncommon in any Cabernet Sauvignon at this price.<br />
  #54204<br />
  Original Price: $8.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $7.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Cousi&ntilde;o-Macul Cabernet Sauvignon   (2006) </strong><br />
  Excellent quality from one of the most consistent wineries in Chile. Full-bodied, dark-fruited, and earthy with ripe tannins.<br />
  #54744<br />
  Original Price: $8.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $7.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Los Vascos Cabernet Sauvignon           (2005)</strong> <br />
  A straightforward Cabernet Sauvignon from the Chilean property of Domaine Lafite Rothschild. It's extremely approachable, with ripe cassis fruit and soft tannins to please anyone's palate..<br />
  #54434</span><br />
  <span class="style2">Original Price: $9.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Vi&ntilde;a Chocolan, Carmen&egrave;re  (2007)  </strong><br />
  Carmen&egrave;re is a grape that originated in Bordeaux but is rarely planted today - except in Chile, where it seems to have found its niche. The resulting wines are fabulous: for proof, try this dark, full-bodied, and delicious everyday red.<br />
  #19317<br />
  Original Price: $10.99<br />
  Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Santa Rita Cabernet Sauvignon Medalla R&eacute;al  (2006) </strong><br />
  A sophisticated, brooding Cabernet from Chile. It shows plenty of dark fruit, with toasty notes and subtle crushed mint. It's incredible with beef braises.<br />
  #54844<br />
  Original Price: $17.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Chono Carm&eacute;n&egrave;re    (2006) </strong><br />
  This is a hearty, dark red wine made from the Carmen&egrave;re grape variety. It's aged in oak for a short period of time to give it just a little spice on the palate. An excellent choice for anything barbecued or meat-based.<br />
  #17923<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Cono Sur Pinot Noir, Vision  (2007) </strong><br />
  We're always pleased to taste a Pinot Noir like this one from Cono: bright, fruity, and varietally correct in so many ways. Aromas of raspberries and cherries dominate the palate. The abundant fruit makes this as clear an expression of New World Pinot Noir as anything on our shelves.<br />
  #19811<br />
  Original Price: $11.99<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Terra Noble Gran Reserva Carmen&egrave;re (2007) </strong> <br />
  The Carmen&egrave;re grape came to Chile via Bordeaux in the late nineteenth century, and lately it's been more at home in South America than France. The red wines made from this grape can range from refreshing and easy-drinking to full-bodied and dense. This is one of the brawnier ones, with rich, dark fruit and a touch of spiciness from oak aging.<br />
  #17595<br />
  Original Price: $14.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Amayna, Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda Valley   (2006) </strong><br />
  Leyda, a sub-region of San Antonio, is located in a valley between the Coastal Mountain Range and the Pacific Ocean, running parallel to Chile's Central Valley. This wine has lots of tropical fruit, dominated by white pineapple and white flowers. A dry, distinctively New World Sauvignon Blanc.<br />
  #19470<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Casa Lapostolle Merlot &quot;Cuv&eacute;e Alexandre&quot;    (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Rich and lovely, this beautiful expression of Merlot is produced in Chile. Its plummy fruit is wrapped in a velvety-smooth texture that only the best Merlots exhibit. Enjoy this with beef stews and braises.<br />
  #58154<br />
  Original Price: $21.99 <br />
