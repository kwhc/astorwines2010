  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">   Ch. Fantin, Bordeaux Sup&eacute;rieur - 2006  (750<strong> mL</strong>)</span><span class="style2"><br />
  The perfect Bordeaux for your steak frites tonight! The nose on this red has classic Cabernet notes of pure blackcurrant fruit that carry through to the palate. The wine is made in a very clean, very &quot;Old World&quot; style, making it a great choice for the table.<br />
#20569<br />
Original Price: $11.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$9.99<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.   Ch. Clerc-Milon, Pauillac - 2005   (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here is a fifth-growth Bordeaux that consistently outperforms its rank. Interestingly, it is one of the few estates that still devote vineyard space (1% of its 43 hectares) to the Carmen&egrave;re variety, once widely planted in Bordeaux but now almost extinct. This is a masculine bottle, full of muscular tannins mellowed by ripe Cabernet Sauvignon fruit.</span> <br />
  #20953<br />
  Original Price: $69.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $59.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>    Ch. Sainte-Marie, Bordeaux Sup&eacute;rieur - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here is a reasonably priced Bordeaux that has all the cassis and dark fruit you'd expect from a much more expensive bottle. The finish has some tannin, from the hefty percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Perfect with steak or beef stew, and ready to drink tonight!</span><br />
  #20718<br />
  Original Price: $15.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $13.59<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.   Ch. de Seuil Blanc, Graves - 2006 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">White wines from Graves are a treat year round. This one is based on S&eacute;millon and Sauvignon Blanc, and is full of bright, refreshing white fruits on the palate.</span> <br />
  #20078<br />
  Original Price: $21.99<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.    Charmes de Kirwan, Margaux - 2005  (750 mL)</strong><br />
  This is Kirwan's second label, and it's just as appetizing as the first! You can't ask for a more generous palate than this, and it's no surprise that this Margaux comes from a formidable vintage like 2005. The fruit is berry-driven, the tannins assertive but accessible, and the spices from the oak aging just right.<br />
#19534<br />
Original Price: $49.97 <br />
Sale Price: $42.47<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.      Ch. de Bonhoste, Bordeaux Blanc - 2008 (750 mL)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Light, crisp, and clean, showing an impressive balance of fruit flavor. This is a great white for sipping with any light cuisine; it goes especially well with fish.</span> <br />
  #10677<br />
  Original Price: $11.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Ch. Haut Segottes, St.-Emilion - 2004 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Danielle Andre took over her father's estate in 1972, and tradition still reigns at Haut Segottes. Harvest is performed manually. Fermentation takes place in cuve. Wines are rotated into barrel for an &quot;&eacute;levage&quot; of approximately 18 months; 20% of the barrels are new. The wine is mostly Cabernet Franc, with the remainder made of Merlot. The result of all this meticulous, traditional winemaking is a spectacular yet elegant red Bordeaux.</span><br />
  #39491<br />
  Original Price: $32.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $28.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.     Ch. La Fagotte, Haut-M&eacute;doc - 2005 (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is a classic Cabernet-based Left Bank Bordeaux. Great cassis notes on the nose carry through to a ripe palate that speaks to the phenomenal vintage in which these grapes were grown. The wine sees some wood, but the oak flavors are skillfully integrated; the finished wine is a full, round, and ready to drink tonight.</span> <br />
  #20804<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.       Ch. La Vieille Cure, Fronsac - 2005   (750 mL)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Fronsac estate has gone through some changes since the new owners took over in the mid-1980s: the glorious old vines are now processed by gleaming, updated facilities. The wine is full of dark fruits - blackberries and cherries - with spicy, assertive tannins.</span> <br />
  #19238<br />
  Original Price: $42.97 <br />
  Sale Price: $36.52<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.  Ch. Merville, Saint-&Eacute;st&egrave;phe - 2001  (750 mL)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here is a rare and happy discovery: a Bordeaux that is evolved enough to drink tonight with your rack of lamb! The tannins have mellowed; primary fruits have become secondary fruits. Leathery, soft, and spicy, this is an excellent example of perfectly aged Bordeaux.</span><br />
  #20397<br />
  Original Price: $26.99<br />
Sale Price: $22.94</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   Ch. l'Ermitage de Bel-Air, Pomerol - 2005   (750 mL)</strong><br />
    <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">It's never easy to find solid Pomerol at a reasonable price, so we positively jumped on this excellent value in Right Bank Bordeaux. Full of wild berries and spices with a touch of raspberry on the palate, it is rich, full-bodied, and very drinkable in its youth.</span> <br />
