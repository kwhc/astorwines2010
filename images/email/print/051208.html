<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">South African Wines </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Kronendal Sauvignon Blanc  (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Sauvignon Blanc is one our favorite year-round white wines. This is dry on the palate yet full of ripe yellow fruits. A great ap&eacute;ritif wine to serve for guests before dinner, it's also a natural match for white meats and fish dishes.<br />
#77234<br />
  Sale Price: $6.79</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Sauvignon Blanc, Buitenverwachting (2006)</strong><br />
  We won't even attempt to sound the name out phonetically, but we will tell you its translation: &quot;beyond expectation.&quot; We found that very apt when we tried this wine. Made partly from vine plantings that are over 80 years old, with some younger ones mixed in as well, it has notes of crisp fresh flowers, peppers and minerals. Still fresh and young, this will evolve wonderfully with a bit of bottle age. From Constantia, a cooler-climate ward of the coastal region of South Africa.<br />
  #14547<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Sincerely Sauvignon Blanc   (2007) </strong><br />
  Crisp and fresh, with aromas of white flowers, white currants, and lime. This is delicious as an ap&eacute;ritif, but even better with seafood or a grilled chicken salad.<br />
  #11519<br />
  Sale Price:   $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Kanonkop Pinotage, Stellenbosch         (2004)</strong> <br />
  Pinotage, a cross of Cinsaut and Pinot Noir, thrives in the Stellenbosch region of South Africa.  Kanonkop has long been recognized as producing the benchmark for this varietal.  Richly fruited with mouth-coating notes of red and black berries in a medium bodied style, this wine has good structure for ageing and avoids the astringency so commonly found with this particular grape variety.<br />
  #10190<br />
  Sale Price: $27.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Mulderbosch Sauvignon Blanc Stellenbosch  (2007)  </strong><br />
  An absolutely beautiful, world-class Sauvignon Blanc. It's very crisp with layers of delicious ripe melon and mineral flavors. Serve with a simple fish dish and let this wine shine.<br />
  #77184<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Rietvallei, Rhine Riesling (2007) </strong><br />
  An overtly fruity Riesling that's all about the upfront aromas of pineapple and white flowers and peaches. Sip alone before during and after dinner. A real crowd-pleaser too when friends drop by. <br />
  #19876<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Cape Indaba Chenin Blanc  (2006) </strong><br />
  One of Astor's best white wine values, this Chenin Blanc has tantalizing aromas of ripe pears and flowers, with exuberant tropical fruit on the palate. This is great with cheeses, fish, and light pasta dishes.<br />
  #70010<br />
  Sale Price:   $5.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Solms Wijn de Caab &quot;Lekkerwijn&quot; Ros&eacute;    (2006) </strong><br />
  The Solms winery is located in the Franschhoek Valley, an area with a Mediterranean climate where Rh&ocirc;ne grape varieties thrive. This wine belongs in the &quot;serious ros&eacute;&quot; category, with nuanced complexity that rewards attentive sipping.<br />
  #19830<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Danie de Wet &quot;Limestone Hill&quot; Chardonnay (2007) </strong> <br />
  The process known as malolactic fermentation, which gives many Chardonnays a buttery aspect, was prevented on this wine so that it would retain a higher level of acidity. The result is crisp food-friendliness and incredible fruit-forwardness. From Robertson, South Africa.  <br />
  #16616<br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Solms &quot;Amalie&quot;, Wijn de Caab (2006) </strong><br />
A dry white blend of Viognier and Grenache Blanc. Fermented and aged for 6 months in French oak, this wine has developed rich, round fruit, with a good dose of yellow plums and fresh vanilla bean.<br />
  #19829<br />
  Sale Price: $22.94 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong> </span><span class="style8">Syrah, Rudi Schultz  (2004) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Rudi Schultz is one of the premier winemakers in South Africa. He has been making wines at the Thelema estate for years now, and is on to his second vintage of this tasty red. Peppercorn and blackberry fruit on the palate mingle with smoke and licorice on the finish. A great backbone of chalky tannins is present here but very approachable today.<br />
