<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">California's &quot;Other Whites&quot; </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Estancia Pinot Grigio </strong></span><strong class="style2"> (2006) </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Medium-bodied and crisp, with flavors of pear and yellow fruit and the faintest suggestion of white pepper on the finish. California has proven itself to be a perfect home for Pinot Grigio &ndash; like so many other grapes &ndash; and started to turn out incredible examples like this one.<br />
#11718</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Grgich Fum&eacute; Blanc, Napa (2006) </strong><br />
This Fum&eacute; Blanc sees a little oak in both fermentation and aging, giving this white a creamy, full mouthfeel. Still, it exhibits the quintessential Sauvignon Blanc flavors of lemongrass and grapefruit.  A great food wine.<br />
#55009<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Zaca Mesa Viognier</strong><strong>    (2006)</strong><br />
This estate-bottled Viognier from Santa Barbara has aromas of honeysuckle and mandarin orange. Deliciously dry on the palate with apricot, mineral, and peach notes. With limited intervention, this Rh&ocirc;ne Ranger has created a great Viognier.<br />
#12984<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. </strong><strong>Edmunds St. John &quot;Shell &amp; Bone&quot; White Blend (2005)</strong><br />
Try this intriguing blend of Viognier and Roussanne and you'll think you're drinking a white Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape.<br />
#17557<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. </strong><strong>Sinskey Abraxas, Scintilla Sonoma Vineyard (2006)</strong><br />
This Alsatian field blend is a first release from Robert Sinskey. This wine sparkles with life - as the name of the vineyard, &quot;Scintilla,&quot; would suggest. Notes of citrus, honeysuckle, and sage won us over immediately. Delicious!<br />
#14414<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6.</strong><strong> Dry Creek Chenin Blanc, Sonoma (2006)</strong><br />
Dry Creek produces wines in small batches, which allows them to bring out the best qualities in each batch of fruit. This Chenin Blanc is dry and crisp, with vibrant aromas of orange blossom, lemon zest, and ripe pear. Grapefruit and lemon zest fill the palate.<br />
#87684<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. </strong><strong>Cold Heaven &quot;Le Bon Climat&quot; Viognier (2005) </strong><br />
Well-balanced California Viognier is hard to come by, so we were floored when we tasted this bottling. It&rsquo;s dry but very ripe and eager to please, with crisp acidity, fresh apricot fruit, and white floral character.<br />
#12694<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4 Robert Foley Pinot Blanc   (2007)</strong><br />
  The Robert Foley winery is a tiny estate located on Howell Mountain. Robert has been making wine in Napa Valley since 1977. His Pinot Blanc brings out the best characteristics of this varietal: The wine sees no oak, and pops with flavors of peach, apricot, and white pepper, with great underlying acidity.<br />
  #19607<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.</strong><strong> Nalle Sauvignon Blanc, Hopkins Ranche (2005)</strong> <br />
This creamy white wine is predominantly Sauvignon Blanc, with just a touch of Semill&oacute;n and Chardonnay blended in for extra body. The wine was aged on its lees for six months, adding to its richness. Shows light grassy and mineral notes on the nose, with a hint of underripe peaches; zesty acidity in the mouth stays clean through the mid-palate, and you&rsquo;ll find lovely ripe Meyer lemon on the long finish. This picks up significant weight after 24 hours. Delicious.<br />
#17213<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. </strong><strong>Whetstone Viognier, Catie's Cornera (2006)</strong><br />
This is organically farmed Viognier from the Russian River Valley that is aged in neutral French oak.  With a creamy mouth feel and lively, fresh acidity, this is a perfect food wine.  Flavors of stone fruit burst on the palate.<br />
#19596<br />
<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Eberle Viognier  (2006)</strong><br />
  Viognier from California is just as exotic as Viognier from France. This full-bodied white wine has refreshing acidity, with classic notes of juicy yellow peaches and a spicy ginger note that lingers on at the finish. Drink with a light chill as an ap&eacute;ritif and you'll wonder why you didn't become a Viognier fan sooner.<br />
