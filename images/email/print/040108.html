  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>La Segreta Bianco, Planeta </strong></span><strong class="style2"> (2006) </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">This unusual blend combines Grecanico, Chardonnay, Viognier, and Fiano into an exciting package. The nose has lovely notes of honeysuckle and lilac in addition to the prominent, crisp citrus and tropical fruits. In the mouth it is unexpectedly rich, oozing orchard fruit flavors with a nice refreshing note of minerality keeping everything taut and lively. This is a great ap&eacute;ritif wine and a lovely choice for simple fish dishes..<br />

  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Nero d'Avola, Poggio Bidini, Valle dell'Acate (2005) </strong><br />
This delicious red wine is made from Nero d&rsquo;Avola grapes grown in the Ragusa region of southeastern Sicily. Aromas of fresh raspberries lead to a hint of cocoa on the finish. This is a clean, easy-drinking red to enjoy every day.<br />
#12037<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Salina Bianco, Hauner</strong><strong>    (2006)</strong><br />
A dry southern Italian white wine that's full of soft yellow fruits, laurel leaf and honey. Made from a blend of Catarratto and Inzolia, two indigenous white grapes that thrive on the mostly volcanic soils of this island..<br />
#19003<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. </strong><strong>Nero d'Avola, Feudo Montoni (2004)</strong><br />
A Sicilian Nero d'Avola that shows pure red-berried fruit, fresh acidity, and a touch of mineral on the finish. This could easily be held for years, but needn't be; if you're drinking it today, it will be excellent after a quick decanting.<br />
#15815<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. </strong><strong>Vrucara, Feudo Montoni (2004)</strong><br />
A hearty, medium-bodied red wine from central Sicily that shows aromas of blueberries, fresh rosemary, fern, and olives, with excellent minerality on the finish. This is clean, unadulterated Nero d'Avola that can easily be held for years to come.<br />
#15814<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6.</strong><strong> Regaleali Bianco, Tasca d'Almerita Sicily  (2006)</strong><br />
This white wine from Sicily is made from the indigenous Inzolia, Catarratto, and Grecanico grapes. It's dry with citrus fruits and mineral on the finish. A delightful everyday white to enjoy with seafood or any other simple fare.<br />

The Cerasuolo di Vittoria area is located in central Sicily. This is a delightful red wine that was both vinified and aged in clay amphorae - an ancient practice that works wonderfully even today. The fruit aromas are pure raspberry, mandarin, and minerals.<br />
#18547<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. </strong><strong>Rosso del Soprano, Palari  (2002)</strong><br />
The fruit on this great red is a combination of delicate red berries, iron, powder, and sweet spice. This comes from northeastern Sicily, in the province of Messina - grown at 1400 feet above sea level. Made from a wild blend of indigenous grape varieties.<br />
#12962<br />
<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Il Frappato, Valle dell'Acate (2006)</strong><br />
