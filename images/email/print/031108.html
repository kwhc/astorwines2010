<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Alsace  Wines</span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Riesling, Hugel </strong></span><strong class="style2"> (2005) </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">Wines from Alsace are some of the best kept secrets. Here we offer you a dry Riesling with ripe peach and apricot aromas. .<br />
#28624</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Gewurztraminer,Trimbach (2005) </strong><br />
Classic Alsatian Gew&uuml;rztraminer - dry, elegant, and mineral, with fine floral aromas. Very nice.<br />
#28594<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong><strong>Pinot Gris Reserve Trimbach    (2003)</strong><br />
Deep, golden tropical fruit is the theme here. Full-bodied and sublimely flavorful, this wine is incredibly rich, yet fully dry, and it shows great balancing acidity.<br />
#22054<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. </strong><strong>Pinot Noir, Boxler (2005)</strong><br />
A handful of vignerons are planting Pinot Noir in Alsace, which has traditionally been considered a white-grape region. These vignerons tend to have prime vineyard sites and an above-average affinity for this spectacular grape. This effort from Boxler is an example of outstanding Alsatian Pinot Noir.<br />
#19445<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Riesling Reserva, Boxler (2005)</strong><br />
  Jean Boxler is, without a doubt, one of the most talented winemakers in Alsace. This Riesling is full of finesse, showing delicate floral fruit and stony minerality.<br />
  #19442<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. </strong><strong>Riesling Grand Cru &quot;Altenberg de Bergbieten&quot;, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Mochel (2005)</strong><br />
Abundant apple flavor and juicy peach scents characterize this Riesling. It's fun to be around, but at the same time shows plenty of seriousness, and it richly deserves its Grand Cru designation.<br />
#19010<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. </strong><strong>Pinot Gris &quot;Vieilles Vignes&quot;, Boxler (2005) </strong><br />
An old-vine bottling of Pinot Gris from an excellent producer and a phenomenal vintage. This is full of plush yellow fruit with a refreshing acidity and concentration that's just beautiful.<br />
#17998<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4. Pinot Blanc, Mittnacht   (2006)</strong><br />
  Biodynamic. Pale peach and pear flavors play against a hint of minerality. This finishes long, with a gentle kiss of sweetness.<br />
  #19575<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. </strong>  <strong>Muscat &quot;Herrenweg&quot;, Zind-Humbrecht (2005)</strong> <br />
The Muscat grape makes beautifully aromatic white wines. This is full of white flowers, white pepper, and grapefruit on the palate. Using the Zind-Humbrecht domaine practice of indicating the dryness of each wine with a number of stars (one star being the driest and five the sweetest), this is a two. On the palate it finishes on the off-dry side.<br />
#18775<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. </strong><strong>Tokay Pinot Gris &quot;Brand&quot;, Boxler (2005)</strong><br />
For some odd reason, Pinot Gris is referred to as &quot;Tokay Pinot Gris&quot; in Alsace - much to the distress of Hungarians, who cherish an entirely different type of Tokaji wine. This dry white comes from the Brand vineyard site, a Grand Cru. It's rich in red currants, spice, and peaches.<br />
#19443<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Riesling Vieilles Vignes, Albert Boxler  (2005)</strong><br />
Boxler wines from Alsace are second to none. Their old-vine Riesling is exquisite, with honeysuckle and peaches on the palate.<br />
