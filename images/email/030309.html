    <span class="style2"><span class="style9"> Burgundies </span> <br />
    (...our lists go up to 11)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">      Bourgogne Blanc, La Burgette - 2007</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Chardonnay is dry yet  fruity, fascinating on its own yet lovely with food, and full of plush  yellow fruit flavors like plum, Meyer lemon, and Golden Delicious  apples. Actually, &ldquo;Golden Delicious&rdquo; would be a perfect nickname for  this wine.</span> <br />
#18415<br />
Original Price: $9.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$8.49<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.     St. Aubin Rouge 1er Cru &quot;Les Rouges Gorges&quot;, Prudhon - 2005 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This 1er Cru bottling is made  from fruit sourced from three lieu-dits, giving it charm and  complexity. The Prudhon estate makes exceedingly feminine wines; this  one combines earthy cassis fruit, wild berries, and spice. </span> <br />
  #21316<br />
  Original Price: $29.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>       Bourgogne Hautes-C&ocirc;tes de Beaune Rouge, Montchovet - 2005</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A lovely, soft, ripe-fruited Burgundy that is ready to serve tonight. Montchovet does a slow fermentation in barrel, followed by a year of barrel age. Still, the wine is far from oaky and primarily shows plush charm.</span><br />
  #21310<br />
  Original Price: $29.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $25.49<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.    Meursault &quot;Perri&egrave;res&quot;, Bitouzet-Prieur - 2003 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A complex white wine from a  winemaker who is a staunch traditionalist in the cellar. This is full  of raw honey, yellow apples, and quince fruit on the palate. The warm  conditions of 2003 made this Meursault a bit fuller-bodied than most.</span> <br />
  #19295<br />
  Original Price: $64.99<br />
  Sale Price: $55.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.     Month&eacute;lie, Jean Garaudet - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The village of Month&eacute;lie is  primarily known for the brilliant red wines it produces. This Pinot  Noir is no exception: vibrantly colored and packed with red berry fruit  (just as the winemaker intended), it has enormous immediate appeal.</span> <br />
#21275<br />
Original Price: $29.99 <br />
Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.         Pouilly-Fuiss&eacute;, L&eacute;onard de St. Aubin - 2004</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Pouilly-Fuiss&eacute; is the name of a village located just north of the Beaujolais region, as well as a white wine made there from Chardonnay grapes. This one shows nicely rounded notes of tangerine and honeysuckle, with a long, mineral-laden finish.</span> <br />
  #19936<br />
  Original Price: $16.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.  Morgon, Lapierre - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Lapierre is a fanatical grape-grower, and we're very glad to be able to reap the benefits. This is amazing for the beauty of its fruit and the purity of its flavor.</span><br />
  #11341<br />
  Original Price: $21.97 <br />
  Sale Price:   $18.67<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.       Vir&eacute;-Cless&eacute;, Dom. de Roally - 2005</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Chardonnay from the M&acirc;con is hardly ever made from estate-grown grapes. Here's a rich version that's full and round in the mouth with yellow apple fruit and fresh almonds on the finish.</span> <br />
  #12727<br />
  Original Price: $26.99<br />
  Sale Price: $22.94<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. &quot;Allez Go&ucirc;tons&quot;, Vin de Table, Derain - 2007</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Aligot&eacute; is known for its bracing acidity and minerality, and this bottle is no exception. The nose is herbal and citrusy with hints of green apple fruit. Make sure to enjoy this with seafood: they're perfect partners.</span> <br />
  #21307<br />
  Original Price: $22.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.     Ladoix, Domaine Petitot - 2005</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The 2005 Burgundy vintage (along with talented growers, of course) produced ripe, sweet-fruited wines from less prestigious villages, at prices that normal humans could afford. This red wine is full of licorice, red fruit, and earth. Decant for best results.</span><br />
  #21135<br />
  Original Price: $29.99<br />
Sale Price: $25.49</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>     Pommard &quot;Noizons&quot;, Jean Garaudet - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Vines here, which range in age  from 20-80 years, grow in terraced vineyards at 250m above sea level,  and the soil is an iron-rich clayey chalk. Superb concentration  combined with great elegance for the appellation.</span> <br />
#19737<br />
