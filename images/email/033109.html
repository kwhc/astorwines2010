  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Bottled by Napa's Joe Briggs,  this is a clean, unoaked Chardonnay with plenty of bright citrus  flavors and round honey notes.

  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>        Mauritson Sauvignon Blanc - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Sauvignon Blanc is a blend  of three vineyard sites in the Dry Creek Valley. Aromas of dried peach  and freshly cut hay waft from the glass.

  <strong>8. Manifesto, Sauvignon Blanc - 2007</strong><br />
  The Suisun Valley east of Carneros is perfect for Sauvignon Blanc, which benefits enormously from the region's diurnal temperature difference. The wine has a slightly grassy and very aromatic nose, which gives way to a clean palate that is devoid of oak and has lots of bright, mouth-watering acidity.<br />

  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. MacMurray Ranch Pinot Gris - 2007 </strong><br />
  Coming from California's Sonoma Coast, MacMurray ranch has created a delicious Pinot Gris that is fruit-forward with notes of fig and white peach, and a lingering finish.  Pair this with scallops or lobster tonight.<br />

<strong>6.            Kenneth Volk Malvasia - 2006</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Malvasia comes from Monterey. Because of its rarity, Kenneth Volk considers this one of his heirloom varieties. The wine shows great acidity, with bright floral notes along with hints of citrus and melon. Delicious!</span> <br />

  <strong>5.  Four Vines Naked Chardonnay - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This wine sees no oak, allowing  the apple and citrus flavors to shine through. A California Chardonnay  with good acidity can be hard to find, but this bottle from Santa  Barbara is in a class all by itself. This is the quintessential food  wine.</span><br />
  #20507<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />

  <strong>2.      Dashe Riesling - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Charming and unorthodox winemaker Michael Dashe sources the grapes that go into this Riesling from the same excellent vineyard that brings us his magical Zinfandel, L'Enfant Terrible. On the nose, you'll get peaches and pineapples. The palate is balanced and harmonious. Who knew Cali Riesling could drink like this?!</span><br />
  #21497<br />
  Original Price: $21.99<br />
Sale Price: $18.69</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>        Lioco Chardonnay, Sonoma County - 2007</strong><br />
