  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">           Quinta do Infantado Tawny Port - NV (750)</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Tawny port just doesn't get  better than this one from Quinta do Infantado. Excellent body,   with rich notes of roasted hazelnuts and sultanas followed by just a hint of  sweetness. Simply delicious. </span> <br />
#50504<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$12.74<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.         Quinta do Infantado, White Port - NV (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">White port is a more rare type  of this fortified wine. In fact, the color is more of an amber color.  This is still showing lots of nut-driven character that could easily  remind one of a lighter-styled madeira. The fruit is fresh too and full  of citrus and almonds. This is on the dry side, but still has a touch of residual sugar.</span> <br />
  #12426<br />
  Original Price: $16.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>         Colheita Madeira, Broadbent - 1996 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Smooth with a nice, full  texture and nutty finish. &quot;Colheita&quot;  ports and madeiras are required to spend 7 and 5 years respectively in oak before  release. This example is pefect as a dessert with Manchego and quince  paste. </span> <br />
  #21233<br />
Original Price: $41.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $35.69<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.  Dow's LBV Port - 2003 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">An LBV (Late Bottled Vintage)  port is different than a vintage port that's bottled two years after  harvest. Bottled anywhere from four to six years after harvest, LBVs  have been aged longer in cask and are therefore more approachable upon  release.</span> <br />
  #20651<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.  Justino's Rainwater, Madeira (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This style of madeira is so named  because it is said to be soft as rainwater and the &quot;color of  straw, glistening after a shower of rain.&quot; Medium-dry, it is perfect  with p&acirc;t&eacute;s and cheeses or as an after-dinner sipper.</span> <br />
#57804<br />
Original Price: $12.99 <br />
Sale Price: $11.04<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.            Graham's Vintage Port - 2003 (375)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Graham's port house is  probably one of the most recognizable names in the port world. Their  style of port is ultra-rich with candied aromas of freshly  macerated black berries. The fruit, sugar and tannin levels are all  elevated, and even more so in this vintage. </span> <br />
  #14481<br />
  Original Price: $49.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $42.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.  Broadbent Madeira 10 Yr. Malmsey - NV (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This dark, amber,  coffee-scented madeira will bring a smile to your face after a meal.  With tangy dark fruits and plenty of woodsy character, it shows all the  caramel complexity we like in these special fortified wines.</span><br />
  #21232<br />
  Original Price: $45.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $39.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.           Charleston Sercial Madeira, The Rare Wine Company - NV (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Charleston Sercial celebrates  the refined, delicate Madeiras that the 18th- and 19th-century  Charlestonians prized. Like any great Sercial, this miraculously  balances power and delicacy. With its nutty, tangy flavors, it is not  only a wonderful aperitif, it's great with many foods.</span><br />
  #12277<br />
  Original Price: $53.99<br />
  Sale Price: $45.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.    Graham's Six Grapes Port - NV (750)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Sweet and fruity, this dark  ruby vintage-character port is a robust wine with a thick, viscous  texture. Earthy, flowery notes show on the nose and there is plenty of  super-ripe, jammy blackberry fruit in the mouth. </span><br />
  #57614<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">19.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.       Fonseca Vintage Porto - 2000 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Fonseca port house was  founded in the early 1800s. This vintage port is incredibly  approachable. The fruit is dark, ripe and full of mullberries. The  tannins are surprisingly accessible today.</span> <br />
  #56106<br />
  Original Price: $94.99<br />
Sale Price: $80.74</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>         Quinta do Infantado Ruby Port - NV (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Elegant and rich, this dark,  juicy Port has excellent balance of fruit, acid, sugar, and tannin. Not  too sweet, not too big, it is easy to drink and enjoy. </span> <br />
