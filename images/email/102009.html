  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">White Port seems like such a  contradiction. This is still the very lovely fortified wine that you've  learned to love, it's just made in a different fashion and therefore  turns a different color. This a great wine with hard cheeses, walnuts  and more. Some people enjoy this just slightly chilled.</span> <br />

  <strong>2.    Quinta do Infantado Vintage Port - 2003 (750) </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span>This is from the quirky vintage of the millennium, we dare say. It's fleshy with dark berried fruit, peppercorns, and dark chocolate.
