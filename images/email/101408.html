    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">Chianti Classico, Querciabella (2006) </span><span class="style2"><br />
When we find a great Chianti Classico producer like this one, it's cause for celebration. This food-friendly red wine shows dark fruit, powder, licorice, and solid tannins. It's all wrapped up in a surprisingly approachable package, but the bottle shows all the signs of ageworthiness.<br />
#17105<br />
Original Price: $27.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$24.99<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Rosso di Montalcino, La Palazzetta  (2005)</strong><br />
  La Palazzetta consistently produces extraordinary Tuscan red wines. Made from organically farmed grapes and aged in large Slavonian oak casks, this bottle shows all of Sangiovese's pure, tangy berry character.<br />
  #10090<br />
  Original Price: $22.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Vernaccia, Giannina     (2007) </strong><br />
  A crisp and refreshing Vernaccia with white floral notes and a hint of vanilla. This is a fruity white that pairs quite well with savory seafood appetizers such as caviar and smoked salmon.<br />
  #43705<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8. Morellino di Scansano, Moris Farms  (2006) </strong><br />
  Decades ago, Moris Farms fought hard for their own appellation of Morellino di Scansano. Years later, their commitment to their vines still shines through in every bottle they make. This hearty red is full of dark, round, earthy berries, with a soothing, velvety texture and approachable acidity.<br />
  #98804<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Chianti Classico, Montesecondo (2005)</strong> <br />
Floral with delicate aromas of black cherries and anise. Medium-bodied with well-integrated tannins and fresh acidity, this is always best with rich Italian fare.<br />
#13870<br />
Original Price: $21.97 <br />
Sale Price: $18.67<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>6. Brunello di Montalcino, La Palazzetta (2003) </strong><br />
  Flavio Fanti, owner of the family estate La Palazzetta, represents one of Montalcino's elite sources of limited-production Brunello, a full-bodied red wine that comes in many shapes and sizes. His ten acres of Sangiovese Grosso in picturesque Castelnuovo dell'Abate is home to several of the zone's finest parcels.<br />
  #16670<br />
  Original Price: $40.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $34.84<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Il Sodaccio, Montevertine (1995) </strong><br />
  When you're looking to go back to basics in Tuscany, stick with classic estates like this one. This bottle is just coming around but could truly be held for well over a decade longer. Full of aromas of black cherries, blackberries, violets, clay, and thyme. Made from old Sangiovese vines that have since been replanted. Only time will tell if Il Sodaccio will ever be made again.<br />
  #16334<br />
  Original Price: $59.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $50.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Le Pergole Torte, Montevertine  (2004) </strong><br />
  This is Montevertine's ultimate achievement. The estate parted ways with the Chianti DOCG in order to be able to make 100% Sangiovese, and here is the much-celebrated result. Aged for at least two years in barrel, the wine has the intensity of a classic Super Tuscan with a lighter feel on the palate and more finesse and elegance.<br />
  #20719<br />
  Original Price: $99.99<br />
  Sale Price: $84.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Brunello, Talenti (2003) </strong> <br />
  An example of just how harmonious and elegant Sangiovese can be. Firm structure gives longevity to this classic, complex Tuscan red.<br />
  #17635<br />
  Original Price: $36.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $31.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Chianti Classico, Val delle Corti (2004) </strong><br />
  This Chianti Classico has abundant flavors of wild red berries, almonds, anise, and violets, all grounded by mineral-laden tannins. The concentration is amazing. This is a wine of immense purity, made in the most traditional of styles and created to celebrate Sangiovese in all its glory.<br />
  #18324<br />
  Original Price: $18.99<br />
Sale Price: $16.14</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong> Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Avignonesi          (2005) </strong><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
This rich red wine is full of blackberries, smoke, fresh tobacco, and violet. An intense bottling with present but approachable tannins, this is ideal with grilled meats and mature cheeses. Made in the area of Montepulciano, located 75 miles southeast of the city of Florence, this accomplished and complex creation is based on Prugnolo Gentile, the local Sangiovese clone.<br />
