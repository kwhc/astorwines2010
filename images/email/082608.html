    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Sicily </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Il Frappato, Valle dell'Acate        (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">A dry red made from Frappato, a very Sicilian grape variety. Pretty from the start, this scrumptious wine is ruby red in color, with firm raspberry fruit and lively acidity. It is the perfect easy-drinking wine to enjoy every day with Italian red sauce dishes.<br />
#42336<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. COS, Cerasuolo di Vittoria (2005)</strong><br />
  A Sicilian red made of Frappato and Nero d'Avola. Red berry fruit, ripe acidity, mineral notes, and a bit of tannin on the finish.<br />
  #10858<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Grillo &quot;Parlante,&quot; Fondo Antico   (2006) </strong><br />
  This dry white wine is pure fruit flavor on the palate - mostly pineapples and oranges - with a ripe and juicy appeal. Grillo is a white Sicilian grape variety best known for its robust contribution to Marsala.<br />
  #13963<br />
  Sale Price:   $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Rosso Ibleo, Gulfi           (2006)</strong> <br />
  The Gulfi winery's entry-level Nero d'Avola, a radiant red that offers juicy raspberry fruit, lively acidity and a touch of spice. This is a wine that benefits from air: try it before and after decanting and you'll easily taste the difference.<br />
  #44441<br />
  Sale Price: $11.87<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Regaleali Bianco, Tasca d'Almerita Sicily  (2007)  </strong><br />
  This dry white wine from Sicily is made from the indigenous Inzolia, Catarratto, and Grecanico grapes. With citrus fruits and mineral on the finish, this is a delightful everyday white to enjoy with seafood or any other simple, light fare.<br />
  #71981<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Carricante/Carjcanti, Gulfi (2004) </strong><br />
  Carricante, a white variety native to Mount Etna, also thrives in the Monte Iblei area of southeastern Sicily. Though truly a wine of finesse, this has a strong and robust structure, with notes of grapefruit, almonds, and chalky minerality on the palate. Decant and enjoy this today or hold it for up to a decade. From a Practicing Organic winemaker.<br />
  #12109<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Salina Rosso, Hauner    (2006) </strong><br />
  The wines from the Hauner estate always express their roots. This blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nero d'Avola is dark, mineraled, and very much like an earthy but fruit-driven Dolcetto. It's great with grilled meats.<br />
  #19004<br />
  Sale Price:   $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Frappato Sicilia, Arianna Occhipinti  (2006) </strong><br />
  If you've never tried a Frappato, you're missing out. Frappato is a local Sicilian red grape variety that always seems to yield wines that are redolent of fresh raspberries. This bottle offers more than just fresh character, however: it shows elegant structure and potent fruit.<br />
  #19755<br />
  Sale Price: $29.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Cerasuolo di Vittoria &quot;Pithos&quot;, COS (2005) </strong> <br />
  The Cerasuolo di Vittoria area is located in central Sicily. This delightful red was both vinified and aged in clay amphorae - an ancient practice that still works wonderfully - as this wine ably shows. The smooth, pleasant palate impression is of raspberry, mandarin, and minerals.<br />
  #18547<br />
  Sale Price: $33.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Outis (Nessuno), Biondi  (2004) </strong><br />
A beautiful red wine from Mount Etna in Sicily, made from a blend of the native Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio grape varieties. On the palate you'll find fascinating, delicate notes of tobacco, red currants, red pepper, and anise.<br />
  #12225<br />
  Sale Price: $22.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Passopisciaro Rosso   (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  This rare red wine is made from vines that are planted on Mount Etna, the active volcano in Sicily. Naturally, the mineral content is distinctive, the fruit dark and luscious. This is a full-bodied, ripe red wine that can age in the cellar for years to come.<br />
