<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style9">California Red Zinfandels </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">Dancing Bull Zinfandel  (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
Entry-level Zin for anyone who wants to get their feet wet. A bit lighter and friendlier than most, this Zinfandel nonetheless shows varietally typical flavors of bramble and dark fruits. Its relatively muted tannins (for a Zin, that is) make it an extremely versatile food wine.<br />
#86322<br />
Original Price: $8.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$7.64<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Ridge Three Valleys, Sonoma County  (2006)</strong><br />
  Ridge's Three Valleys bottling is a field blend, consisting mainly of Zinfandel. It's a hearty, full-bodied red wine, dense with black fruit and chocolatey tannins.<br />
  #11053<br />
  Original Price: $22.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Dashe &quot;l'Enfant Terrible&quot;, Zinfandel     (2007) </strong><br />
  What puts this Zin in a class all its own, apart from its low alcohol and solid tannic structure, is that it is fermented using natural yeasts, rather than commercial ones. This gives it all the character of its place of origin, the Alexander Valley. On the nose, it's full of sweet mixed red and black berries, but the palate is totally dry. A rare treat from the Zin category.<br />
  #20797<br />
  Original Price: $25.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $22.09<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8. Klinker Brick Old Vines Zinfandel  (2005) </strong><br />
  This hearty, full-bodied red comes from Zinfandel vines that are well over 50 years old. Aromas of dark fruit contrast with fresh herbal notes; this also shows intense concentration, packed with berry flavors set off by spicy oak.<br />
  #18161<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Cline Zinfandel, California (2006)</strong> <br />
Fred Cline has restored some of California's oldest vineyards.  Even this wine, at this price, is old vine Zinfandel.  It shows in complexity and intensity.<br />
#62594<br />

Sale Price: $9.34<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6. Ballentine Napa Zinfandel (2005</strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>) </strong><br />
  We were very excited to add this new Zinfandel to our collection. This winery takes care to find a true expression of the grape variety, using careful practices in both the cellar and vineyard. Richly textured fruit and good balance abound in this wonderfully priced Cali Zin. Well done!<br />

  <br />
  <strong>5. Mauritson Zinfandel, Dry Creek  (2006) </strong><br />
  The Mauritsons have been growing grapes in Sonoma since the 1870s. Beginning with the 1998 vintage, the family (led by winemaker Clay Mauritson) has been making its own wine. The fruit for this Dry Creek Zinfandel comes from four different vineyard sites, creating a wine that is complex and well-balanced, with notes of dark chocolate and black plum.<br />
  #14054<br />
  Original Price: $24.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Quivira Zinfandel, Dry Creek  (2005) </strong><br />
  Quivira is a small, organic, family-run estate in the heart of Sonoma. This Zinfandel is produced with fruit from several different vineyards throughout the Dry Creek Valley. It shows bright red raspberry fruit with underlying layers of tobacco, cedar, and mocha.<br />
  #15225<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Ridge Zinfandel Paso Robles (2006) </strong> <br />
  Paso Robles produces some of the biggest, fullest Zins around, and this is no exception. Bursting with raspberry and boysenberry fruit and with an exceptional, ageworthy structure. We haven't seen Paul Draper's Paso Robles bottling in several vintages, and we're thrilled to have it back!<br />
  #63944<br />
  Original Price: $31.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $27.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Sobon Estate Zinfandel, Hillside (2006) </strong><br />
  This delicious Zinfandel is produced from old vines in Amador County. Flavors of cocoa and blackberries ooze from the glass, making this sturdy and bold wine an absolute joy with hard cheeses or a grilled steak.<br />
  #16976<br />
  Original Price: $9.99<br />
Sale Price: $8.49</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong> Nalle Zinfandel, Dry Creek Valley          (2005) </strong><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
Lovely raspberry aromas and dry, earthy aromatics greet the nose, followed by a moderate dose of oak. This medium-bodied Zin shows good acidity and tannins that are supportive yet unobtrusive. It has succulent, intense strawberry fruit on the palate, and a finish that is a touch compressed at the moment. Lingering earth and light toast notes frame the brambly fruit. This is an exceptionally civilized California Zinfandel.<br />
