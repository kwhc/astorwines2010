  <span class="style2"><strong>10.       Txakolina, Ameztoi - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Drinking this Basque wine is a  lot easier than saying the names of the grapes in it: Hondarribi Zurri  and Hondarribi Beltza. Dry and light-bodied with mineral-driven fruit  and aromas of grapefruit and lemon, it is a perfect wine for seafood.</span><br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This unique little Ribera  marries the juiciness of Beaujolais with the dark fruit of traditional  Ribera. It's quite fruit-forward and totally unoaked, making it a nice  quaffer on its own or with a simple platter of cheeses and charcuterie.</span> <br />

  <strong>8.      Tres Picos Borsao - 2007 - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Old-vine Garnacha shows  brilliantly in this Tres Picos bottling. Red berries and cherries dance  on the palate while earthy notes and balanced acidity keep things  lively through the finish.</span><br />

  <strong>7.       Ribera Sacra &quot;Vi&ntilde;a Caneiro&quot;, D. Ventura - 2007 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">An elegant example of the Menc&iacute;a grape that is reminiscent of a juicy cru Beaujolais. With grapey ease, lithe fruit, and great acidity, this cool-climate treat might change your perception of Spanish wines.</span> <br />

<strong>6.         Rueda Verdejo &quot;Casamaro&quot;, Garciarevalo - 2008</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A complex and exuberantly fruity white wine made from both young and extremely old Verdejo (145 years). On the nose, this wine offers an array of aromas - from peaches, to citrus, to tropical fruits - that carry through to the palate. Garciarevalo practices sustainable farming and makes this wine from 100% free-run juice, which is vinified in stainless steel to preserve its freshness. The wine has remarkable intensity while being crisp and clean: it's an excellent choice for people who love Sauvignon Blanc.</span> <br />

  <strong>5.   Vi&ntilde;a Mein, Ribeiro - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Vi&ntilde;a Mein comes to us from a  tiny DO in northwestern Spain called Ribeiro, which means &quot;riverside&quot;  in the Galician language. Many rivers crisscross this area, creating a  cool, damp environment that is perfect for making clean, crisp whites.  This one pairs quite well with seafood.</span> <br />

  <strong>4.         Gravonia Rioja Blanco, Lopez de Heredia - 1998</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is the newly released  vintage of Lopez de Heredia's &quot;young&quot; white wine. In the flush of  youth, it is ready to drink, but of course shows the complexity of the  slow, gentle aging process this house is famous for. Practicing Organic.</span> <br />
  #11424<br />
  Original Price: $24.99<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.  AN/2 Anime Negra, Spanish Red - 2005</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Tried a Mallorcan wine lately?  This small-production red comes from 50- to 100-year-old vines of the  indigenous varieties Callet, Mantonegro, Fogoneu, and Monastrell; the  fruit is hand-picked and fermented with native yeasts. With an  intriguing nose of bougainvillea and jasmine, and a lush mouthfeel with  dark chocolate, coffee, and black plum flavors, this is a must-try.</span> <br />

  <strong>2.      Vi&ntilde;a Bosconia Reserva, Lopez de Heredia - 2000</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Coming from the family-run and  very traditional Lopez de Heredia estate, this wine has notes of  strawberry, blood orange, pomegranate, coconut, and exotic spices. Vi&ntilde;a  Bosconia is produced from the juice of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo,  and Graciano, aged for three years in American oak barrels. The winery  is one of the few in Rioja still owned by its founding family.</span> <br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Made from 100% Tempranillo  grown on vines that are over 30 years old, this red is a blend of  modern expertise and Old World charm. Aged in American barrique for 18  months, it shows warm, toasty vanilla notes blended with black cherry  and cloves. Lively acidity makes it excellent with food, and it has a  pleasant finish that sticks around forever.</span> <br />
