  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Wyatt Chardonnay          (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">A very nicely balanced wine: perfectly ripe tropical fruit flavors, with just a hint of oak at the fringes, are buoyed by clean, fresh, perfect acidity. Choose this wine if you need something to set the mood for a light dinner.<br />
#10452<br />
  Original Price: $11.99<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Foxglove Chardonnay, Edna Valley (2007)</strong><br />
  Foxglove is the brainchild of brilliant winemaker Bob Varner, who is renowned for the Varner wines he crafts with his brother. This Chardonnay is sourced from Edna Valley, a small wine region located close to the Pacific Ocean. The Valley's cool, foggy summers and clay-loam soils produce a well-balanced, mineral-driven, beautifully complex wine.<br />

  <br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Four Vines Naked Chardonnay   (2006) </strong><br />
  This wine sees no oak, allowing the apple and citrus flavors to shine through. A California Chardonnay with good acidity can be hard to find, but this bottle from Four Vines is in a class of its own: it's the quintessential food wine.<br />
  #20507<br />
  Original Price: $11.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $10.19<br />

  <strong>8. R. Mondavi Chardonnay Carneros           (2005)</strong> <br />
  One of the most popular California Chardonnays, this wine from Robert Mondavi is versatile and extremely easy to drink. A lush, buttery texture supports pure, up-front fruit flavors.<br />
  #64384</span><br />
  <span class="style2">Original Price: $17.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Ch. St. Jean Chardonnay, Sonoma  (2007)  </strong><br />
  Think of a vanilla-scented cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, with fresh pear and pineapple slices on the side, and you're halfway to tasting this consistently delicious Sonoma County Chardonnay.<br />
  #81084<br />
  Original Price: $9.99<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Sonoma Cutrer Sonoma Coast Chardonnay (2005) </strong><br />
  Using grapes from their renowned &quot;Cutrer&quot; and &quot;Vine Hill&quot; vineyards, Sonoma Cutrer has added a stunning new Chardonnay to their esteemed family of wines. Well-balanced with a citrusy nose and slightly oaky flavors, this is the perfect wine for grilled fish.<br />
  #17672<br />
  Original Price: $24.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Heitz Cellar Chardonnay    (2006) </strong><br />
  Operating since the early 1960s, Heitz Cellar remains a family-owned, family-operated winery.  Heitz recently revamped the flavor profile of its Chardonnay by reducing the amount of new oak it sees, allowing the wine's fresh acidity to shine through.<br />
  #13614<br />
  Original Price: $21.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Eberle Chardonnay  (2006) </strong><br />
  This is packed with bright green apple flavors and carefully integrated oak that never detracts from the fresh, beautiful fruit. Aromas of biscuit and vanilla bean on the finish make this a prime wine for the dinner table, but its freshness means that it could easily double as an ap&eacute;ritif.<br />
  #18449<br />
  Original Price: $13.99<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Sebastopol Chardonnay, Vine Hill Ridge (2006) </strong> <br />
  Established by Tracey and Joe Dutton, Sebastopol wines were created to express the true character of Chardonnay. This comes from a plot of the Dutton Palms vineyard in Green Valley, a cool-climate sub-appellation of the Russian River. With notes of fresh citrus and a true Burgundian feel, it will be welcome on any table.<br />
  #60084<br />
  Original Price: $21.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Melville Chardonnay, Inox   (2007) </strong><br />
  &quot;Inox&quot; means stainless steel in French; Melville chose this name for their small-lot Chardonnay because the wine is completely unoaked. Aged on the lees for five months, it has an ultra-rich mouthfeel and intense minerality.<br />
  #20060<br />
  Original Price: $42.99<br />
  Sale Price: $36.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Knights Valley Chardonnay   (2006) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  A great value from one of America&rsquo;s most highly regarded Chardonnay producers. Even beyond its impeccable pedigree, this wine gives us a lot to get excited about: hand-picked, hand-sorted fruit; native yeast fermentation; 100% French oak barrels (all 2 and 3 years old); high-altitude vineyards; cool-climate growing conditions; volcanic soils; and traditional winemaking practices. This is a special wine. It's rich and delicious, and drinking very well today.<br />
