<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>     Dashe &quot;l'Enfant Terrible&quot;, Zinfandel - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">What puts this Zin in a class  all its own, apart from its low alcohol and solid tannic structure, is  that it is fermented using natural yeasts rather than commercial ones.  This gives it all the character of its place of origin: the Alexander  Valley. On the nose, it's full of sweet mixed red and black berries,  but the palate is totally dry. A real treat from the Zin category.</span> <br />
