  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">             Pinot Noir &quot;Cuv&eacute;e A&quot;, Anne Amie - 2007 </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Cuv&eacute;e A is a classic Oregon  Pinot Noir. The bouquet is filled with aromas of spices, fresh black  raspberries, and hints of toast. On the palate, you'll find cranberries  and ripe black cherries, with accents of sage and cinnamon. The finish  is lively and long, with a clean freshness that invites another sip.  Excellent with seafood, such as salmon or halibut.</span> <br />

  <span class="style2"><strong>10.          Argyle Pinot Noir, Willamette Valley - 2007  </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Rich and fruity Pinot Noir is  the focus at this winery in the Willamette Valley in Oregon.  Medium-bodied, soft berry fruit and simply great varietal character  keeps us coming back for more. </span> <br />
  #00122<br />
  Original Price: $28.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>           A to Z &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot; Red - 2005 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A hearty Oregon red that is  100% barrel-fermented for 18 months. This is an unusual blend of grape  varieties from Bordeaux, Spain and the Rh&ocirc;ne. Beautifully aromatic,  with succulent flavors of plums, currants, boysenberries and cocoa. A  powerful, fruit-forward wine, this is excellent when you're in the mood  for something different.</span> <br />
  #17950<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.    Ponzi, Pinot Gris - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A full-bodied, unoaked  expression of Pinot Gris with round yellow plums, smoky aromas, and a  floral finish. The texture is rich and can easily stand up to any  number of fish or white meat dishes.</span> <br />
  #20543<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.   Maysara &quot;Jamsheed&quot; Pinot Noir - 2006</strong><br />
  This rather luscious Pinot Noir from McMinnville, Oregon is a great example of the fruit-forward style of American Pinot Noir that so many have grown to love. On the nose, the wine gives plenty of floral berry character. Though heavy on the jammy fruit, the palate is balanced and soft, and supple tannins round out the equation.
  <br />
#20563<br />
Original Price: $29.99 <br />
Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.              Alloro Pinot Noir - 2006</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Especially coming from such a  young winery, this is an impressively advanced bottle of Pinot Noir.  Its distinct aroma of musk makes it unlike any Oregon wine we've ever  had. This is full of mixed red berry flavors and reminds us of a great  Burgundy.</span> <br />
  #18200<br />
  Original Price: $39.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $33.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.    A to Z Chardonnay - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">It's quite the success story:  This Chardonnay came about through a partnership of the two families  that founded A to Z in 2001 - and A to Z is now the fastest-growing  winery in the Willamette Valley. Fermented and aged mainly in stainless  steel, this white wine has a bright, crisp character.</span> <br />
  #15789<br />
  Original Price: $14.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.           Rock Point, Pinot Noir - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Oregon Pinot Noir is  particularly Burgundian, which is probably why we love it so much! The  nose is full of brambly, dried red fruits that carry through to the  palate. This wine is all about delicacy and finesse.</span> <br />
  #20963<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.      Ransom &quot;Junehog,&quot; Oregon - 2007</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Fascinatingly aromatic yet  admirably poised and restrained, this idiosyncratic blend of  M&uuml;ller-Thurgau, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, and Riesling will startle you  - but it'll do it quietly. Bits of the bouquet call to mind a nice  Chardonnay (which seems to be the one white grape that isn't in this  blend), yet there are innumerable exotic aromas and flavors flitting  around a solid core of firm acidity. This is a must-try: aside from  being delicious, it's completely unlike anything we've ever had.</span><br />
  #18648<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">17.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.         Penner-Ash Viognier - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A wonderful dry white wine with  subtle fruit and floral flavors: citrus and pear take center stage, but  a subtle minerality is present as well. The wine is unoaked and aged on  the lees for 5 months before bottling.</span> <br />
  #19436<br />
  Original Price: $59.99<br />
Sale Price: $50.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>         Stringtown, Pinot Noir - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This luscious Pinot Noir comes  from various plots of prime vineyards located throughout the beautiful  Willamette Valley in Oregon. This red wine is full of raspberry and  cherry fruit on the palate.</span> <br />
