  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                     Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner &quot;Rabenstein&quot;, D&uuml;rnberg Falkensteiner Rieden - 2007 (750)</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A complex and yellow-fruited  Gr&uuml;ner that shows lovely round character in the mouth. This is  definitely a full and plush rendition of the grape that will delight  you if you're not a fan of its more herbal and citric renditions.</span> <br />
#21509<br />
Original Price: $17.99<br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$14.99<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.               Zweigelt Ros&eacute;, Nigl - 2008 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Imagine a Loire Valley ros&eacute; but full of even more exuberant raspberry, cranberry, and tart cherry fruit on the nose. Though the aromatics reminded us of the Loire, we were delighted to find that the wine wasn't as astringent as some Loire examples can be. Refreshing and delicious.</span> <br />
  #21627<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner, Glatzer - 2007 (750) </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This basic Gr&uuml;ner from Glatzer  will knock your socks off. It is approachable and full of fresh, zingy,  herbal notes, as well as peppery freshness on the nose and palate.  Perfect if you have yet to experience the magic of Gr&uuml;ner. </span> <br />
  #21641<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">11.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $10.19<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.           Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner &quot;Obere Steigen&quot;, Huber - 2007 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner comes in many  forms, and this is one of its rounder and more full-fruited  manifestations. The wine is unoaked and dry, with a broad mid-palate  full of white flowers and pears.</span> <br />
  #20465<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.            Blauer Zweigelt, Berger - 2007 (LTR)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A cross between the  Blaufr&auml;nkisch and St.-Laurent grapes, the richly colored Blauer  Zweigelt grape was developed in 1922 &ndash; by one Dr. Zweigelt. This  value-driven Austrian red wine is round and smooth, with lively cherry  scents and flavors.</span> <br />
#56674<br />
Original Price: $13.99 <br />
Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.  Riesling D&uuml;rnstein Federspiel, Alzinger - 2007 (750)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A dry Riesling packed with lime  and kumquat fruit, notes of petrol and lots of minerals. Despite its  power, this magnificent wine maintains a perfect balance among all its  elements.</span> <br />
  #19215<br />
  Original Price: $36.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $31.44<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5.  Temento, Tement - 2008 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This light, aromatic white wine  is a blend of Welschriesling and Sauvignon Blanc from the limestone  hills of Austria. Welschriesling (no relation to Riesling) adds  beautiful citrus and floral notes to this wine as a hint of clove spice  peeks through. Perfect as an ap&eacute;ritif, or paired with green salads and  asparagus.</span><br />
  #12615<br />
  Original Price: $14.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
<br />
  <strong>4.                 Riesling &quot;Gobelsburger&quot;, Schloss Gobelsburg - 2008 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">With notes of green tea,  verbena, pear, lime-blossom, and wisteria, this is an absolute  masterpiece from the Schloss Gobelsburg estate. A gorgeous, structured,  and focused Riesling.</span> <br />
  #15553<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.           Blaufr&auml;nkisch, Neckenmarkter, Moric - 2006 (750)</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">With this wine, it is truly a  challenge to decide which is more amazing, the nose or the palate. The  nose gives intense dark berry and floral, violet notes. The palate is  focused with well-integrated tannins that indicate great potential to  age. Fortunately the only decision one needs to make is the decision to  take a bottle home. The wine is aged for 18-20 months in oak but  woodiness doesn't show on the nose or palate. Cellar or decant for best  results.</span> <br />
  #20780<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">52.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $45.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.   St. Laurent &quot;Klassisch&quot;, Rosi Schuster - 2007 (750)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A complex Austrian red showing  peppercorn, cumin, and dark berry notes on the nose. St. Laurent is a  relative of Pinot Noir, so expect a lighter style of wine marked by the  great acidity that is a strength of cool-climate wines. Delicious,  ripe, and unwooded.</span> <br />
  #21358<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
Sale Price: $16.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>  Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner, Berger - 2008 (LTR)</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Generally, though this is our oldest liter bottle of Gr&uuml;ner, it is also the best. It's incredibly zingy, with lemon and apple acidity, but also ripe and inviting... almost dangerously so. A perfect choice for parties, and for everyday drinking with an assortment of lighter foods.</span> <br />
#20808<br />
Original Price: $12.99<br />
Sale Price: $11.04</span></p>
