  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Melville is owned by father and son Ron and Chad Melville, with Greg Brewer as their winemaker. After owning several vineyards in Napa, Ron Melville came to Santa Rita and never looked back. The microclimate of the Santa Rita Hills appellation, which is characterized by cool temperatures, prominent coastal winds, and foggy mornings, is well suited to growing the grapes of Burgundy. This Chardonnay offers aromas of toast, white peaches, and grapefruit. It is refreshingly bright and carries a lengthy finish.</span> <br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Joe Davis is a master of California winemaking. He studied in Burgundy, adopting many Old World techniques, and later brought them to his efforts in Santa Barbara, California. This Chardonnay will remind you of a white Burgundy, but it shows more exuberant notes of citrus, white flowers, and stony minerals on the finish. A sophisticated California Chardonnay.</span> <br />
