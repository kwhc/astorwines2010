  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                    C&ocirc;tes-du-Rh&ocirc;ne Ros&eacute;, Domaine de la Bastide - 2008</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Despite its &quot;watermelon Jolly  Rancher&quot; color, this ros&eacute; is bone-dry, with intense cherry notes on the  nose and crystalline fruits on the palate.</span> <br />
#21349<br />
Original Price: $11.99<br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$10.19<br />

  <span class="style2"><strong>10.               Viognier VdP, Cuilleron - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Born in the hills of the  northern Rh&ocirc;ne, this Viognier is rich with notes of peaches and spice.  Winemaker Yves Cuilleron is a fourth-generation vigneron who strives to  revitalize Seyssuel's vineyard, which was popular in Roman times.</span> <br />
  #23841<br />
  Original Price: $29.99

  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Gigondas, Dom. de Cabasse - 2005 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here is a spicy and minerally Gigondas that will benefit from a few years in the cellar (or you can simply decant it before dinner). Dark fruits abound on the palate, and this shows lots of structure, tang, and tannin for a Grenache-based Rh&ocirc;ne wine.</span> <br />
  #20933<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">24.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $21.24<br />

  <strong>8.          C&ocirc;tes du Rh&ocirc;ne &quot;Cuv&eacute;e la Vignerone&quot;, Gour de Chaul&eacute; - 2007 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Aline Bonfils has created an uncommonly complex Grenache-based red wine. Old vines impart concentration and depth, while aromas of undergrowth nicely set off the approachable dark fruit. Great with grilled steak.</span> <br />
  #15669<br />
  Original Price: $13.99<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.           C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie, &quot;Cuv&eacute;e Classique&quot;, Rostaing - 2004</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This entry-level cuv&eacute;e comes from Ren&eacute; Rostaing, one of the masters of the northern Rh&ocirc;ne.   The Cuv&eacute;e Classique is a blend of grapes from different vineyards in the C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie, and it shows dark blueberry, tobacco, and brambly tannins.</span><br />
#16330<br />
Original Price: $49.99 <br />
Sale Price: $42.49<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.  Crozes-Hermitage, Dom. Mucyn - 2007</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The Crozes-Hermitage appellation is located in the northern part of the Rh&ocirc;ne Valley. At the Mucyn estate there's an abundance of granite on their vine slopes resulting is a rich, full-bodied red wine that isn't affected by new oak. The emphasis here is on the Syrah fruit: spice, smoke, dark berries, and licorice. Full of complexities that evolve in the glass.</span> <br />
  #20675<br />
  Original Price: $21.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $18.69<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5.  Counoise VdP, Rami&egrave;re, Monpertuis - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A very pretty Vin de Pays from  the southern Rh&ocirc;ne. It's on the lighter side, a little bit rustic,  fairly distinctive, and very charming and delicious.</span> <br />
  #46521<br />
  Original Price: $11.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $10.19<br />
<br />
  <strong>4.                Vacqueyras Blanc, Dom. de Montvac - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Vacqueyras Blanc is a rare find. Made from Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc, this white wine shows a rich, creamy mouthfeel and underlying toasty notes. Domaine de Montvac has been handed down from mother to daughter for 4 generations. These vines are 30 years old and grown in chalky clay soils, giving this wine an alluring minerality.</span> <br />
  #18440<br />
  Original Price: $29.99<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.           St.-Joseph, Graillot - 2007 </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Alain Graillot, one of the top producers in the northern Rhone appellation of Crozes-Hermitage, also produces a minuscule amount of Saint-Joseph from a 1 &frac12;-acre plot of 20-year-old Syrah vines planted in decomposed granite soils. Fermentation takes place in concrete, and the wine is aged for 12 months in 1- to 6-year-old barrels. This has the explosive, vivid, deep, and peppery fruit that characterizes Alain&rsquo;s wines, but with the unique charm and freshness of a Saint-Joseph.</span> <br />
  #10146<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">37.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $32.29<br />

  <strong>2.   VdT &quot;Cuv&eacute;e du Sommelier&quot;, Dom. de Boissan - NV</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A light and extremely tasty young-vine Grenache that shows the skill of vigneron Christian Bonfils. Juicy and showing lots of tart cherry and sumac on the nose, this is sure to delight on its own as a summer quaffer or with lighter fare.</span> <br />
  #21711<br />
  Original Price: $8.99<br />
Sale Price: $7.64</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>  Tavel, Ch. Trinquevedel - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here is a dry, candied, and powdery ros&eacute; that shows uncanny freshness and vivid acidity on the palate. A blend of Grenache, Bourboulenc, and Clairette, this full-bodied Tavel can be enjoyed all year round, but it adds an especially elegant touch to summer barbecues.</span> <br />
