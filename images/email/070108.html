    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Alsace    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Gentil, Hugel     (2006 </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">This dry white wine is made from a blend of grapes, and has a pleasing mix of spicy and floral characteristics. It is a great match for p&acirc;t&eacute; or trout.<br />
#21784<br />
  Sale Price: $11.04</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Pinot Blanc &quot;Cuv&eacute;e George&quot;, Ginglinger (2006)</strong><br />
  A lush, golden Pinot blanc that's full of white flower aromas and peach flavors. This complex and fruit-driven white wine is great with shellfish or white meats.<br />
  #17745<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Muscat &quot;Herrenweg&quot;, Zind-Humbrecht   (2005) </strong><br />
  The Muscat grape makes beautifully aromatic white wines. This is full of white flowers, white pepper, and grapefruit notes. According to the Zind-Humbrecht domaine practice of indicating the dryness of each wine with a number of stars (one star being the driest and five the sweetest), this is a two: It's never cloying on the palate, but finishes on the off-dry side.<br />
  #18775<br />
  Sale Price:   $33.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Riesling, W. Gisselbrecht         (2006)</strong> <br />
  Here we have an off-dry, fruit-driven white wine that is extremely easy to appreciate. This is great before dinner as an ap&eacute;ritif, and also works well with spicy meals.<br />
  #18939<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Gew&uuml;rztraminer, Trimbach (2005)  </strong><br />
  Classic Alsatian Gew&uuml;rztraminer: dry, elegant, and mineral, with fine floral aromas. A very nice bottle, and an excellent introduction to one of the most delicious and distinctive grape varieties there is.<br />
  #28594<br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Sylvaner &quot;Sono Contento&quot;, A. Seltz (1996) </strong><br />
  The Sylvaner grape renders wines with an earthy, floral appeal that we've appreciated for years. Add to that the remarkable weather in this vintage and you'll be astounded at how this relatively unknown white grape performs with age.<br />
  #19947<br />
  Sale Price: $40.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Pinot, &quot;C&eacute;page Pinot Noir&quot; Blanc, Jean Pierre Dirler  (2005) </strong><br />
  This is an extremely rare find: a white wine made from Pinot Noir grapes. By immediately separating the grape skins from the juice after crushing, Dirler prevents the finished wine from being imbued with the full red color of the skins. The result is this very dry, faintly copper-tinged wine, which has an earthy nose and a near-saline minerality that emerges with a bit of exposure to air. This bottle is an uncommon treat that is well worth seeking out.<br />
  #20080<br />
  Sale Price:   $28.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Riesling Grand Cru &quot;Altenberg de Bergbieten&quot;, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Mochel    (2005) </strong><br />
  Abundant apple flavor and juicy peach scents characterize this Riesling. It's fun to drink, but at the same time shows plenty of seriousness; it richly deserves its Grand Cru designation.<br />
  #19010<br />
  Sale Price: $31.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Riesling &quot;Katzenthal&quot;, Binner (2004) </strong> <br />
  This unfiltered Riesling is fuller in body than you might expect. It shows the classic peach-and-apricot fruit profile of the best examples of this varietal, but there's a good dose of citrus as well. Organic.<br />
  #12769<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Cr&eacute;mant, Dirler  (2005) </strong><br />
Just recently released, this Pinot Blanc-based sparkler is a true stunner, in part because it was aged on the lees until early 2008. With zero dosage, this is incredibly focused, like all Dirler wines. It shines with floral fruit and mineral character.<br />
  #20255<br />
  Sale Price: $19.54 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Pinot Noir, Boxler   (2005) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  A handful of vignerons are planting Pinot Noir in Alsace - which has traditionally been considered a white-grape region. The most successful of these pioneers tend to have prime vineyard sites and an above-average affinity for this spectacular grape. This effort from Boxler is an example of outstanding Alsatian Pinot Noir.<br />
