<p><span class="style1">Astor's Top Australian Wines </span><span class="style2"><span class="style9"></span>  <br />
    (our lists go  up to 11)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                 Three Rings Shiraz - 2007</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Made from a trio of fine  winemakers in the Barossa Valley of Australia. This speaks Barossa in  the sense that it's bold, incredibly ripe and compote-fruit-like and  it's spicy and full of coffee tannins on the finish. </span> <br />
#18190<br />
Original Price: $19.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$16.99<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.             Amaroo Shiraz - 2007 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">With blackberry fruit and a  spicy finish, this Shiraz will go with everything from a summer  barbecue to lighter fare. It's friendly enough to please a crowd, yet  complex enough to reward repeated tastings; try it alongside a few  different cuisines to see how it changes with food.</span> <br />
  #12235<br />
  Original Price: $11.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>              Jacobs Creek Chardonnay - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Big, round Barossa character on a modern-styled Aussie white. </span> <br />
  #53074<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">6.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $5.94<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.       Heartland Cabernet Sauvignon - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">From the Langhorne Creek, this  Cabernet offers powdery notes and smashed granite mineral on the nose.  The wine is full of dark fruit notes mingling nicely with hints of  spice from 12 months in oak. Rich, ripe, and full bodied. </span><br />
  #21161<br />
  Original Price: $13.99<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.      Yering Station Pinot Noir - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">With aromas of herbs, cherries,  raspberries, and warm spices on the palate, this medium-bodied wine is  quite stunning. Open a bottle tonight and you&rsquo;ll immediately understand  why Yering Station has received tremendous accolades in Australia this  past year.</span><br />
#53415<br />
Original Price: $17.99 <br />
Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6.                 Burge Family Garnacha, Barossa Valley - 2005 </strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A full-bodied red wine with  dark berries - blackberries, currants and blueberries - with a touch of  mint and spice on the finish. Moderate tannins help to balance out the  fruit character. Made from mostly 80-year-old vines that have been dry  farmed. 80 years ago, Garnacha wasn't as popular as the &quot;port-like&quot; red  wines of those days. Burge didn't follow trends, however, and the  estate has those ancient Garnacha vines to this day. Today, Rick Burge  propagates his vineyard from old-vine cuttings.</span> <br />
  #13271<br />
  Original Price: $44.99
  <br />
Sale Price: $38.24<br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. Avignon, Kaesler - 2005</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This savory red wine is  medium-bodied by Australian standards. It spends 12 months in older  oak, with the Grenache contributing soft fruit aromas, the Shiraz  adding peppery spice, and the Mourv&egrave;dre giving a nice edge to the  tannins.</span> <br />
  #19441<br />
  Original Price: $24.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.              Paxton AAA, Shiraz Grenache - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This blend of 75% Shiraz and  25% Grenache is also grown biodynamically. Rich with spicy character,  but not over the top thanks to the softening effect of the Grenache</span>.</span> <br />
  #20915<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.        Kay Brothers &quot;Amery Vineyards&quot; Hillside Shiraz - 2004</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Kay Brothers is one of the  oldest wineries in McLaren Vale, and over the years they've truly  perfected their craft. This is a smoky, full-bodied red wine that's  full of dark, fleshy berried fruit and eucalyptus. Far more subtle than  what you might expect from an Australian Shiraz.</span> <br />
  #14284<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">29.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.             d'Arenberg Shiraz, Footbolt - 2005</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Rich, full-flavored Shiraz  sourced from late-19th-century vines in the heart of South Australia's  McLaren Vale. Marvelous texture with plum, blackcurrant, and blueberry  flavors paving the way to a long, rewarding finish.</span><br />
  #53094<br />
  Original Price: $17.99<br />
Sale Price: $15.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong> Richard Hamilton Viognier - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Viognier is aged for a  short period of time in oak, which adds a touch of body and complexity.  The wood never obscures the fruit in this dry white wine, however, and  it remains very clean and pure on the palate. With aromas of pineapple,  white flowers and mixed peaches, this is an elegant ap&eacute;ritif wine, or  an excellent match for light meat dishes and seafood.</span> <br />
#16914<br />
