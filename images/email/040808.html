    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Sak&eacute;s </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Otokoyama Sak&eacute;, Junmai</strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">One of the most popular sak&eacute;s, this very dry (SMV +10) bottle from Hokkaido features grain-based flavors and vivid acidity. This full-bodied sak&eacute; is a traditional favorite with izakaya fare and beef-based dishes such as yaki-niku.<br />
#59694<br />
  Sale Price: $22.94</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Poochi-Poochi Sak&eacute;</strong><br />
  Slightly sparkling, off-dry, and only lightly filtered, this sak&eacute; shows delightful, creamy notes of rice, buttermilk, and cantaloupe. Gently turn the bottle upside down once before opening. Enjoy chilled as an ap&eacute;ritif.<br />
  #11896<br />
  Sale Price: $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Kanbara &quot;Wings of Fortune&quot; Sak&eacute;, Junmai Ginjo</strong><br />
  This is a Genshu sak&eacute;, and therefore richer than you might expect since it has not been diluted with water (as most sak&eacute;s are). Vibrant, concentrated, and spritzy, it is full of round raw coconut and honeydew flavors.<br />
  #18195<br />
  Sale Price:   $33.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. </strong><strong>Ohyama Sak&eacute;, Tokubetsu Junmai</strong><br />
  Ohyama makes a very well-structured sak&eacute;, fully showcasing the distinctive yeast indigenous to Yamagata prefecture. This full-bodied sak&eacute; starts sweet before unleashing its additional layers of complexity, leading to a medium-dry finish. Serve chilled or warm.<br />
  #59684<br />
  Sale Price: $22.94<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. </strong><strong>Akitabare Koshiki Juntsukuri Sak&eacute;, Junmai </strong><br />
  Aromas of white flowers and citrus. Rich with a sharp rice character to it. A versatile sak&eacute; that can be enjoyed with either a light chill or light warming. <br />
  #23112<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6.</strong><strong> Sato No Homare Sak&eacute;, Junmai Ginjo</strong><br />
  A dry and delightful sak&eacute; with firm flavors of green melon, citrus, and apples.<br />
  #17363<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5.</strong><strong> Dassai Migaki &quot;Niwari Sanbu&quot; Sak&eacute;, Junmai Daiginjo </strong><br />
  Niwari-Sanbu means &quot;23%,&quot; meaning that each kernel of rice was milled down to 23% of its original size - resulting in a subtle, delicate brew that can please the most demanding sak&eacute;phile. It is lithe in texture with aromas and flavors of honeydew melon and McIntosh apples.<br />
  #16762<br />
  Sale Price:   $62.89<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4. Dewazakura Sak&eacute;, Daiginjo</strong><br />
  Rich and full of pineapple fruit aromas on the palate, this drinks well as an ap&eacute;ritif or alongside rich, meaty fish dishes like halibut. The bottle sports a detail that is quite rare for a sak&eacute;: the brewer has chosen to list its vintage, indicating when the rice was harvested.<br />
  #14114<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.</strong><strong> Ryusei Tokubetsu Sak&eacute;, Junmai</strong> <br />
  Simply beautiful on the nose and palate, this sak&eacute; never disappoints with its soft, intriguing aromas of honeydew, cantaloupe, and orange peels. It is fruity and approaching off-dry on the palate. Enjoy it lightly chilled.<br />
  #14163<br />
  Sale Price: $30.59</span><span class="style2"><br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. Daishichi Kimoto Classic Sak&eacute;, Junmai</strong><br />
&quot;Kimoto&quot; refers to the yeast starter used to ferment this sak&eacute;. Some argue that this original method used to ferment the brew results in a deep, rich sak&eacute; with more ripe flavors than acidity - and we tend to agree with them.<br />
  #15239<br />
  Sale Price: $30.59 </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  </span><span class="style2"><strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Koshinohomare &quot;Shiboritate&quot; Sak&eacute;, Junmai Nama Genshu</strong><br />
  This seasonal sak&eacute; is released every spring. It's an unpasteurized Genshu (the latter term means that it's not diluted with water, as most sak&eacute;s are). This year's brew is flat-out delicious - strongly reminiscent of fresh cream and citrus fruits on the palate. If you tasted this blind, you might guess it was a Nigori: it's just that creamy in texture. Well worth a try, whether you're a beginner or a lifelong sak&eacute; drinker.<br />
