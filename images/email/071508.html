<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Australia    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Over the Shoulder, Sauvignon Blanc     (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">We were blown away by the fresh fruit flavors of this Sauvignon Blanc. In fact, the bright citrus and herbaceous fruit characteristics had us completely fooled: we never would have guessed that this was from Australia.<br />
#18016<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. d'Arenberg Shiraz, Footbolt (2004)</strong><br />
  Rich, full-flavored Shiraz sourced from late-19th-century vines in the heart of South Australia's McLaren Vale. Marvelous texture with plum, blackcurrant, and blueberry flavors paving the way to a long, rewarding finish.<br />
  #53094<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Tamar Ridge &quot;Devil's Corner&quot; Pinot Noir   (2005) </strong><br />
  How often do you see a Pinot Noir from Tasmania? This bottle represents an opportunity that may not come around again for a while. It is an easy-to-drink red, full of soft, spicy berry fruit flavors.<br />
  #18202<br />
  Sale Price:   $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Evans &amp; Tate Chardonnay, Margaret River          (2006)</strong> <br />
  A portion of this wine is fermented in barrique to add texture and a touch of warm flavors - vanilla in particular. Malolactic fermentation is avoided in order to maintain the wine's firm, fresh acidity. Full of tropical fruit and ripe peaches, with excellent minerality and complexity on the palate.<br />
  #17947<br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Grant Burge Riesling, Thorn Family Vineyard (2007)  </strong><br />
  Grant Burge is a fifth-generation winemaker located in the Barossa Valley. This Thorn Ridge Riesling comes from Barossa's Eden Valley, which is a cooler microclimate known for producing crisp whites. This dry white wine has a leesy nose, with fresh lime and underlying sage on the palate. A perfect match for oysters.<br />
  #15047<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Loan, Semillon (2005) </strong><br />
  Australian white wines have to be made with particular diligence in order to maintain good levels of refreshing acidity. Dry-farmed and aged in neutral French oak, this white has been well taken care of, and tastes terrific before, during, and after dinner. Incredibly ripe with pear and quince fruit aromas.<br />
  #20062<br />
  Sale Price: $17.84<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Kangarilla Cabernet Sauvignon (2006) </strong><br />
  Lush with juicy, dark berries and a touch of mint on the palate. This full-bodied red is all about fruit and appoachability; it's easy to drink alone, and great with steak.<br />
  #13359<br />
  Sale Price:   $17.84<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Kilikanoon &quot;Prodigal&quot; Grenache (2005) </strong><br />
  This is a brawny, full-bodied red wine that's full of blackberries, blueberries, and chocolate on the palate. Full of concentration and a great pick for those who like bold wines, this would be great with steak and fries.<br />
  #19271<br />
  Sale Price: $23.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Tapestry &quot;Bakers Gully&quot; Shiraz (2006) </strong> <br />
  Tapestry wines are unorthodox in many ways. Most importantly, it's not all about fruit, fruit, fruit with them: while this wine has lots of dark berries and plums on the palate, there are also subtle minerals, cedar, and hints of spice.<br />
  #19979<br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Avignon, Kaesler  (2005) </strong><br />
This savory red wine is medium-bodied by Australian standards. It spends 12 months in older oak, with the Grenache contributing soft fruit aromas, the Shiraz adding peppery spice, and the Mourv&egrave;dre giving a nice edge to the tannins.<br />
  #19441<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Shaw and Smith, &quot;M3&quot; Vineyard Chardonnay   (2006) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Shaw and Smith's overarching goal is to prove that Australia can grow grapes that are typically grown in cooler climates. This Chardonnay is impressive in every sense. Full of white floral fruits, it is reminiscent of a southern French white Burgundy, made with hand-picked fruit that is aged in neutral French oak.<br />
  #20063<br />
  Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$25.49</span></p>
