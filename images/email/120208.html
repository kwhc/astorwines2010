    <span class="style2"><span class="style9">Beaujolais Wines </span> <br />
    (... our lists go up to 11)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">  Beaujolais-Villages VV, Ch. du Chatelard - 2007 (750<strong> mL) </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong></strong> <br />
This old-vine Beaujolais shows bright red fruit with underlying notes of clay and limestone minerality. Flavors of wild blackberries and currants abound, with a hint of earth just beneath the surface. Bright, lively acidity makes this an excellent food wine.<br />
#19957<br />
Original Price: $12.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$11.04<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Chiroubles, C. Pacalet - 2006 (750 mL) </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A wine of character with distinct terroir. It has an earthy edge, but it&rsquo;s the fruit that shines here: ripe raspberries, orange rind, cherry, and a touch of musk. Very fresh and very pretty, yet maintaining a mien of rusticity, the wine is produced organically, with no sulphur added.</span> <br />
  #11953<br />
  Original Price: $19.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. </strong> <strong>Beaujolais Blanc, Ch. du Chatelard - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">No, your eyes aren't deceiving you: this is indeed a white Beaujolais. Chardonnay is by far in the minority when it comes to wine production in this region. This one is unoaked, ripe, and pleasantly round in texture. It has also gained incredible concentration from the impressive age of the vines. Give it a try tonight!</span> <br />
  #19462<br />
  Original Price: $14.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.  Morgon VV, Daniel Bouland - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">One of the 10 crus of the Beaujolais region, Morgon is noted for producing wines with darker, more powerful fruit profiles than are typical of the Gamay grape. Excellent character with a rustic, earthy edge that pairs well with the charcuterie (sausages, hams, country p&acirc;t&eacute;s) so widely enjoyed in the region &ndash; not to mention here in NYC.</span><br />
  #14222<br />
  Original Price: $19.99<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Beaujolais &quot;Pierre Chermette&quot;, Vissoux - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span>Brimming with fresh, bright, red raspberry fruit, this is a thirst-quenching wine of purity and finesse. It shines even among the scores of lively Beaujolais bottlings on the market today.<br />
#21118<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6. Beaujolais Chardonnay, Terres Dor&eacute;es, Brun - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Fruit, fat, and finesse, not to mention a solid mineral structure, garner rave reviews for this versatile white wine.  For great value in Chardonnay, it can't be beat.</span> <br />
  #22654<br />
  Original Price: $15.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Juli&eacute;nas, Dom. du Clos du Fief, Michel T&ecirc;te - 2006 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This red wine is made from the Gamay grape variety. On the nose you'll find hints of black pepper, followed by ample fresh cherry fruit on the palate.</span><br />
  #13055<br />
  Original Price: $21.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4.  Fleurie, Clos de Roilette - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong> <br />
  Complex, structured, broad-shouldered cru Beaujolais with pure berry fruit, floral notes, and herbal accents. Excellent now - and even better in five years.<br />
  #28964<br />
  Original Price: $21.99<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.   Beaujolais-Villages &quot;La Lutine&quot;, Dom. des Terres Vivantes - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This wine is an irresistibly lively pink-hued ruby red in the glass, a color that captures the spirit of the wine. On the nose and palate, the wine gives plenty of juicy Gamay fruit along with a healthy dose of granite mineral on the finish. The name &quot;Lutine&quot; means &quot;little elfin girl&quot; - which seems an apt image to associate with this light, joyous wine. The estate farms sustainably with no chemical pesticides, and uses only natural yeasts.</span> <br />
  #20993<br />
  Original Price: $13.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.  Beaujolais-Villages, La Burgette - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
  Sometimes people forget that Beaujolais is actually a part of Burgundy. The wines of Beaujolais are made from Gamay - Burgundy&rsquo;s &ldquo;other red grape.&rdquo; This bottle is full of tangy red fruits and makes a delightful match for sausages or even grilled salmon.<br />
  #18416<br />
  Original Price: $10.99<br />
Sale Price: $8.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>   C&ocirc;te-de-Brouilly &quot;Terres Dorees&quot; Jean-Paul Brun - 2007 (750<span class="style8"><strong> mL) </strong></span><strong></strong> </strong><br />
Jean-Paul Brun refuses to use laboratory yeasts or add sugar to his wines - two practices that are very common in Beaujolais. His wines turn out light-bodied, juicy, and eminently quaffable: this one is brimming with red fruit.<br />
