    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">Bodegas Real &quot;Nazares&quot; Tempranillo - 2008</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This red is made from  Tempranillo, Spain's best-known grape variety. &quot;Nazares&quot; comes from  younger grape vines and emphasizes a youthful fruit quality; the palate  is full of fresh blueberry and cherry flavors. This is a dry, lighter  style of Tempranillo that's great with appetizers like cured meats or  Spanish omelettes. From the La Mancha region.</span> <br />
#20368<br />
Original Price: $8.99<br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$5.99<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.                  Savia Viva, Cava Brut - NV </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Very clean and very pretty,  this Cava is laced with soft aromas of fresh lime zest and goes  perfectly with spicy foods. This floored us when we first tasted it &ndash;  and then we found out it was organic, too.</span> <br />
  #18508<br />
  Original Price: $11.99<br />
  Sale Price: $8.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9.    Rueda &quot;Spring in a bottle&quot;, Verderol - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">White wines from Rueda are all about freshness. Nothing is more telling than drinking it from the latest vintage. This is fresh off the boat and showing amazing citrus fruit and vibrant floral aromas. A dry, everyday type of wine that's excellent before and during dinner, this pairs extremely well with seafood.</span> <br />
  #21888<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">9.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price: $8.49   <br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8.               Rioja Tinto &quot;Rayos Uva&quot;, Olivier Rivi&egrave;re - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is a fruity, all-stainless-steel-raised Rioja from very old vines in Rioja Alta. The winemaker is a Frenchman who fell in love with Rioja. The wine is bursting with black fruit and spice that comes from Graciano (rather than new oak).</span> <br />
  #22028<br />
  Original Price: $14.99<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7.              Ribeira Sacra, Vi&ntilde;a do Burato, D. Ventura - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The &quot;sacred banks&quot; of the Sil  and Mi&ntilde;o rivers, just inland from R&iacute;as Baixas in Galicia, are so steep  that they demand careful and laborious hand-harvesting. Ventura's old  vines, along with his abhorrence of filtration and chemical yeasts,  give this dark-fruited, pulpy wine its succulence. The wine is 100%  Mencia, the grape of Bierzo, its neighboring DO. Unlike many of the  jammier offerings of Bierzo, this Mencia has rusticity and fresh,  punchy acidity reminiscent of a Cru Beaujolais.</span> <br />
#20540<br />
Original Price: $18.99 <br />
Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6</strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>.   Vi&ntilde;a Cubillo Rioja, Lopez de Heredia - 2003</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
</span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Cubillo is Lopez&rsquo;s answer to Rioja Crianza. Following the style of all their wines, this wine could be labeled a class above - as a Reserva - but they keep it a Crianza. It compares to most other Rioja wineries&rsquo; Reservas since the wine is aged for three years in oak, followed by another two to three years in bottle. The resulting wine is fruit-forward but with very developed, older-wine aromas of cherries and spices.</span> <br />
#19903</span><span class="style2"><br />
Original Price: $25.99 <br />
Sale Price: $22.09</span><span class="style2"><br />
</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5.   Mesoneros de Castillo &quot;Roble&quot; Ribera - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This bottle is for the lover of modern Ribera. The fruit is pure blackberry with a hearty dose of tobacco and minty oak on the nose. In the glass it's nearly opaque and the finish shows some smoke and tannin; this is perfect for a slab of meat.</span> <br />
  #20600<br />
  Original Price: $19.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
<br />
<strong>4.                    Milcampos Tempranillo, Ribera del Duero - 2006<br />
</strong></span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is a juicy and pulpy Tempranillo from Ribera that sees no oak at all and is remarkably fresh on the palate. There are coffee notes on the nose and delightful ripe tannins on the finish. Perfect with a well-prepared medium-rare steak and french fries.</span> <br />
  #20790<br />
  Original Price: $13.99<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3.    Vi&ntilde;a Tondonia Rosado, Lopez de Heredia - 1998 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This rosado has a copper-orange  color with gold at the rim and red at the core. The nose is a  mesmerizing, ever-changing mosaic of orange, cinnamon, tobacco, and  stones. On the palate it shows complex flavors of apricot, pomegranate,  cinnamon, butterscotch, and cloves, then becomes delicate and ethereal  on the finish.</span> <br />
  #10562<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">24.99</span> <br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.    Albari&ntilde;o &quot;Ambar&quot;, Granbaz&aacute;n - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">One of the top producers of serious Albari&ntilde;o in Spain. Granbaz&aacute;n makes a couple different types, this &quot;Ambar&quot; is their best - made from free-run juice only. Floral and dry, with aromas of limes and stony fruit. Minerally and made to last.</span> <br />
  #42309<br />
  Original Price: $24.99<br />
Sale Price: $21.24</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>     Gravonia Rioja Blanco, Lopez de Heredia - 1999</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is the newly released  vintage of Lopez de Heredia's &quot;young&quot; white wine. In the flush of  youth, it is ready to drink, but of course shows the complexity of the  slow, gentle aging process this house is famous for.</span> <br />
