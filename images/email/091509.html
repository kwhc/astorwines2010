</strong></span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">You can't go wrong with this  red beauty from the little-known village of St. Aubin. Prudhon offers  value in Pinot Noir. This vintage shows dark cherry fruit, spice and a  note of raspberry on the finish.</span> <br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr"></span><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">It's no wonder that Ghislaine  Barthod's wines have so much finesse, she learned from her father,  Gaston, who came from the Jura, where light-handed elegance is the  order of the day.

Sale Price: $29.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>     Pernand-Vergelesses Blanc, Rollin - 2004</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Some of the most astounding  white Burgundy these days comes from lesser-known villages such as this  Chardonnay from Pernand-Vergelesses. You can find tremendous  satisfaction in the bouquet itself: cream, leesy floral aromas and  mineral. The palate is equally satisfying and clearly points in the  direction that this can be held for years to come.</span> <br />
