    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">Long Flat Yarra Valley &quot;Destinations&quot;, Pinot Noir - 2006 </span><span class="style2"><br />
Straightforward, compote-y, and nicely spiced, this is a modern, approachable expression of Pinot Noir.<br />
#15186<br />
Original Price: $11.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$10.19<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.  Shaw and Smith, &quot;M3&quot; Vineyard Chardonnay - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Shaw and Smith's overarching  goal is to prove that Australia can grow grapes that are typically  grown in cooler climates. This Chardonnay is impressive in every sense.  Full of white floral fruits, it is reminiscent of a southern French  white Burgundy, made with hand-picked fruit aged in neutral  French oak.</span> <br />
  #20063<br />
  Original Price: $29.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9.  Grant Burge Riesling, Thorn Family Vineyard - 2007 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Grant Burge is a  fifth-generation winemaker located in the Barossa Valley. This Thorn  Ridge Riesling comes from Barossa's Eden Valley, which is a cooler  microclimate known for producing crisp whites. This dry white wine has  a leesy nose, with fresh lime and underlying sage on the palate. A  perfect match for oysters.</span> <br />
  #15047<br />
  Original Price: $19.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8. Holy Trinity, Grant Burge - 2002</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This hearty, Rh&ocirc;ne-like, red  wine is named after an Anglican church of the area. It's spicy, packed  with mixed dark berries and vanilla. An excellent match to any  meat-based cuisine - especially grilled sausages. </span> <br />
  #74035<br />
  Original Price: $37.99<br />
  Sale Price: $32.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Over the Shoulder, Sauvignon Blanc - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">We were blown away by the fresh  fruit flavors of this Sauvignon Blanc. In fact, the bright citrus and  herbaceous fruit characteristics had us completely fooled: we never  would have guessed that this was from Australia.</span> <br />
#18016<br />
Original Price: $14.99 <br />
Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6. Avignon, Kaesler - 2005 (750)</strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This savory red wine is  medium-bodied by Australian standards. It spends 12 months in older  oak, with the Grenache contributing soft fruit aromas, the Shiraz  adding peppery spice, and the Mourv&egrave;dre giving a nice edge to the  tannins.</span> <br />
  #19441<br />
  Original Price: $24.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.  Tamar Ridge &quot;Devil's Corner&quot; Pinot Noir - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">How often do you see a Pinot  Noir from Tasmania? This bottle represents an opportunity that may not  come around again for a while. It is an easy-to-drink red, full of  soft, spicy berry fruit flavors</span><br />
  #18202<br />
  Original Price: $15.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Burge Family Garnacha, Barossa Valley - 2005</strong> <br />
  A full-bodied red wine with dark berries - blackberries, currants and blueberries - with a touch of mint and spice on the finish. Moderate tannins help to balance out the fruit character. Made from mostly 80-year-old vines that have been dry farmed. 80 years ago, Garnacha wasn't as popular as the &quot;port-like&quot; red wines of those days. Burge didn't follow trends, however, and the estate has those ancient Garnacha vines to this day. Today, Rick Burge propagates his vineyard from old-vine cuttings.<br />
  #13271<br />
  Original Price: $44.99<br />
  Sale Price: $38.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Yering Station Pinot Noir - 2006</strong> <br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">With aromas of herbs, cherries,  raspberries, and warm spices on the palate, this medium-bodied wine is  quite stunning. Open a bottle tonight and you&rsquo;ll immediately understand  why Yering Station has received tremendous accolades in Australia this  past year.</span> <br />
  #53415<br />
  Original Price: $17.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2.  Black Chook Shiraz Viognier - 2007 </strong><br />
  McLaren Vale has an unrivaled reputation in Australia, and indeed the  world, for growing full-flavored Shiraz that is ripe yet balanced. This  one makes use of a technique perfected in France's C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie: the  winemakers add a little Viognier to the mix, creating a stunning and  complex wine.<br />
  #19312<br />
  Original Price: $16.99<br />
Sale Price: $14.44</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>  Kay Brothers &quot;Amery Vineyards&quot; Hillside Shiraz - 2004</strong><br />
Kay Brothers is one of the oldest wineries in McLaren Vale, and over the years they've truly perfected their craft. This is a smoky, full-bodied red wine that's full of dark, fleshy berried fruit and eucalyptus. <br />
#14284<br />
