  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">                       Gavi di Gavi, La Merlina - 2007</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Another great white wine from Piedmont. Dry and a touch reticent upon opening, this flourishes after a few minutes in the glass with notes of raw honey, fresh lemons, and rusty minerality.</span> <br />
#12842<br />
Original Price: $15.99<br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$13.59<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.                  Grignolino &quot;Poggeto&quot;, La Casaccia - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This tasty red wine from Piedmont is made from the Grignolino grape, and comes from 50-year-old vines. The pale cherry-red color is captivating. The palate boasts the freshest imaginable red berry flavors, with hints of white peppercorn. This red has such pristine fruit and great mineral-laced acidity that you'll be aching for more before you know it.</span> <br />
  #12753<br />
  Original Price: $11.99<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9.   Verduno Pelaverga, Fratelli Alessandria - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A medium-bodied red wine from the northern Piedmontese area of Verduno. The rare Pelaverga grape is grown mostly in this region, where chalky soils predominate - and that terroir clearly shines through in the wine. Aromas of red berries, black tea, and that chalkiness work very well together here.</span> <br />
  #13970<br />
Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">18.99</span>  <br />
  Sale Price:   $16.14<br />

  <strong>8.              Freisa d'Asti &quot;Cento Filari&quot;, Lo Spaventapasseri - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">The name of this estate means &quot;little sparrow&quot; in Italian. Freisa can sometimes be a touch p&eacute;tillant, but not in this case: this red wine is completely without fizz. With classic notes of Piedmontese soil on the nose, dark fruits melding with purple flowers, and hints of tar, this is a light-bodied and lively wine.</span> <br />
  #21931<br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Ghemme is an appellation in Piedmont known for its lighter, more approachable Nebbiolo. Violets, rose petals, earthy cherries, and fine rustic acidity shine through in this  distinctively northern Italian red wine.</span><br />

</span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This rich, ripe, dark-fruited Langhe Rosso is made from 100% Nebbiolo. On the nose you'll get earthy, tarry notes as well as blackberry and plum. The fruit flavors are quite ripe and sweet but with a spicy, tannic edge and a hint of espresso bean on the finish. Drink with hearty fall fare.</span> <br />
#21999</span><span class="style2"><br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A great value in Nebbiolo for those of you who crave Barolo but are saving that bottle for the right occasion. This is drinking very well right now: berries, plums, and almonds shine through on the palate, and the finish is firm and tannic.</span> <br />

  <br />
  <strong>3.    Langhe Rosso &quot;Superboum&quot;, Az. Agr. Bricco del Cucu - 2007</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Langhe Rosso is a blend of Dolcetto and Merlot. The wine is fermented and aged in stainless steel to preserve the wine's enticing dark cherry aromas and flavors. On the label, you'll see a depiction of a local fresco. The name of the wine is a play on words, meaning both &quot;pride&quot; in Latin and &quot;supercool&quot; in contemporary Italian slang. This is a fabulous bottle, full of concentrated, sweet fruit but also structure and tannin, resulting in a superbly balanced finished product.</span> <br />
  #21988<br />
  Original Price: $<span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblNewBottlePrice">18.99</span> <br />
