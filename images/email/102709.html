  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A new offering from Chile. This  is a gleaming, pale yellow wine with notes of green. It offers plenty  of fruit, both tropical and citrus, with slight herbal notes. In the mouth it has a  young, lively citrus taste, plus other tropical fruit flavors. Great  body and a long finish. </span> <br />

<strong>9.    Amayna, Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda Valley - 2008<br />
</strong></span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Leyda, a sub-region of San  Antonio, is located in a valley between the Coastal Mountain Range and  the Pacific Ocean, running parallel to Chile's Central Valley. This  wine has lots of tropical fruit, dominated by white pineapple and white  flowers. A dry, distinctively New World Sauvignon Blanc.</span> <br />

  <strong>8.               Amayna, Pinot Noir - 2006</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Pinot Noir in Chile has come a  long way since it was first planted there, and we were extremely  impressed with the Amayna bottling. Taste this wine blind and there can  be no doubt that this is pure, delicious Pinot Noir (albeit a bit  heftier in style than most). It's full of wild raspberries, dark  cherries, and spice.</span> <br />

  Original Price: $28.99<br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />

  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">From the Curico Valley of Chile  comes this rich Cabernet Sauvignon. Pretty blackberry and red cherry  fruits greet the nose, and there is a touch of mint on the finish.</span> <br />

  Original Price: $8.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $7.64<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />

  </span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Here is an award-winning  Bordeaux blend based on the Carmen&egrave;re variety, which used to be widely  planted in Bordeaux and now thrives in Chile. The wine is made from the  estate's oldest vines, the berries picked and de-stemmed by hand for the  highest possible quality. A big and age-worthy red wine.</span> <br />
  #21038</span><span class="style2"><br />
  Original Price: $89.99<br />
  Sale Price: $76.49</span><span class="style2"><br />

  <strong>5.    Chono Reserva Carm&eacute;n&egrave;re - 2006 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This is a hearty, dark red wine  made from the Carmen&egrave;re grape variety. It's aged in oak for a short  period of time to give it just a little spice on the palate. An  excellent choice for anything barbecued or meat-based.</span> <br />

  </strong></span><span class="style2"><span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">This Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmen&egrave;re, and Cabernet Franc is built like a Pauillac: dense yet elegant, with raspberry ganache, blackcurrant, and fig fruit layered with loam, tobacco, mineral, and cedar notes. Impressive balance among tannins, acidity, and oak.</span> <br />

  <br />
  <strong>3.     &quot;Neyen&quot; Espiritu de Apalta, Colchagua - 2004 </strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">Neyen means &quot;spirit&quot; in the  native Mapudungun language. The Neyen vineyard was the first in Apalta  (Colchagua valley); these Carmen&egrave;re and Cabernet Sauvignon vines were  planted in 1890. This red wine is a full-bodied and full of spiced cassis and  blackberry fruit.</span> <br />

<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong>     Echeverria Unwooded Chardonnay - 2008</strong><br />
  <span id="ctl00_middleContent_lblDescr">A Chardonnay unlike any other  in the New World. This is a hand-crafted wine without any trace of oak  influence. Aromas of tropical fruits and pears intermingle with  mouthwatering acidity, while the wine retains a lovely round feel on  the palate. </span> <br />
