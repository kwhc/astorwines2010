<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style9">California Cabernet Sauvignons </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>11. </strong></span><span class="style8">Norton Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa - 2006</span><span class="style2"><br />
With notes of mocha and cassis, this has all of the characteristics that make reds from California, and Cabernet Sauvignon in particular, such a treat. Decant this wine for a great experience.<br />
#16562<br />
Original Price: $17.99 <br />
Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$15.29<br />
</span><br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10.  Liberty School Cabernet Sauvignon - 2005 </strong><br />
  Pure, straightforward Cabernet character: flavors of dark berries, cassis, and milk chocolate. This is well-balanced in the mouth and carries itself with considerable elegance. A firm structure makes it perfect with grilled meats.<br />
  #99014<br />
  Original Price: $14.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Chalk Hill Cabernet Sauvignon, Sonoma</strong><br />
  Warm coffee and jam on the nose here, with blackcurrant on the palate and a structure that makes this wine a perfect candidate for the cellar. If you're going to drink this monster tonight, just make sure to air it out for a little while in a decanter first - then enjoy it with something meaty.<br />
  #65204<br />
  Original Price: $65.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $56.09<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>8. Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon Alexander Valley</strong><br />
  This Silver Oak bottling is produced from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from several different vineyard sites. It is an elegant, highly expressive wine that exhibits notes of nutmeg, cassis, black plum, and sandalwood, followed by an extremely long finish of savory ripe fruit. Ever since Silver Oak was founded in the early '70s, the winery has dedicated itself entirely to Cabernet Sauvignon.<br />
  #61615<br />
  Original Price: $74.99<br />
  Sale Price: $63.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Honig Cabernet Sauvignon - 2006 </strong><br />
Somehow Honig's well-made, organic Napa wines have managed to stay under the radar, but this Cabernet is certainly worth discovering: it has a deep, ruby-red color and a complex bouquet. On the palate, we got flavors of black cherry, cocoa, spice, and green tea. This is aged for 20 months in American oak barrels, only 30% of which are new. Well-balanced and well-structured.<br />
#67334<br />
Original Price: $34.99 <br />
Sale Price: $29.74<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
<strong>6. Sterling Cabernet Sauvignon Napa - 2005 </strong></span><span class="style2"><br />
  A well-oaked, deeply hued red wine with structure and complexity that belie the Sterling's reasonable price tag. Fresh mixed berry flavors mingle with an earthy, woodsy character; drink this Cabernet Sauvignon with rich roasts or your favorite soft cheeses.<br />
  #69184<br />
  Original Price: $23.99
  <br />
  Sale Price: $20.39<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5.Foxglove Cabernet Sauvignon, Paso Robles - 2006 </strong><br />
  Foxglove is the brainchild of winemaker Bob Varner. This red shows bright cassis fruit, balanced acidity, and alluring tannins; you'll definitely be asking for seconds.<br />
  #17498<br />
  Original Price: $13.99 <br />
  Sale Price:   $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Ramsay Cabernet Sauvignon, North Coast - 2006</strong> <br />
  Ramsay is Kent Rasmussen's side project. Made with fruit sourced from farmers throughout Napa Valley, this unique red shows notes of cassis, toasty vanilla, and hazelnuts.<br />
  #19390<br />
  Original Price: $11.99<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Dominus, Napa - 2003 </strong> <br />
  Dominus Estate wines are made solely from grapes grown on the historic Napanook vineyard.  This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot shows ripe fruit, balanced acidity, and lively tannins on the finish. Decant and enjoy today, or hold this bottle for 10 -15 years. (Okay, this is a Meritage blend on a list of our top 11 Cabernets - but Dominus goes where Dominus wants!) <br />
  #14250<br />
  Original Price: $12.99 <br />
  Sale Price: $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Peju Cabernet Sauvignon - 2005 </strong><br />
  Chocolate and fleeting eucalyptus aromas show up on this brilliant Napa Cabernet. Dark stone fruits and spice flavors on the palate lead to a well-structured finish. This is an outstanding red wine that could age beautifully for years. <strong>An Astor Staff Pick!</strong><br />
  #11683<br />
  Original Price: $39.99<br />
Sale Price: $33.99</span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><strong>1.</strong><strong> Eberle Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve</strong><br />
This Reserve Cabernet drinks like a gem. It shows rich cassis fruit, with a restrained overlay of toasty oak that doesn&rsquo;t obscure the dusty terroir that sets it apart from so many gigantically fruity California wines. This little-known bottling merits a serious comparison with classed-growth Bordeaux.<br />
#18448<br />
Original Price: $64.99<br />
Sale Price: $55.24<br />
