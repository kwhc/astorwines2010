  <span class="style2">A cross of Riesling and Silvaner, the white M&uuml;ller-Thurgau grape is more typically found in Germany, but does extremely well in the high altitudes of the Alto Adige in Northern Italy.

  <strong>6. Diana, Trevisani (2003) </strong><br />

  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Teroldego Rotaliano, De Vescovi-Ulzbach  (2006) </strong><br />
  If you're a fan of California Syrah or Zinfandel, try a red Teroldego from Italy. The grapes for this exceptional example come from old vines planted in limestone-based soil, high up in the Dolomites. Dark in color, the wine displays concentrated aromas of juicy dark currants, violets, graphite, and stony minerals on the finish. Hand-harvested and fermented in steel tanks with naturally occuring vineyard yeasts.<br />

  <strong>4. Schioppettino, Girolamo Dorigo    (2006) </strong><br />
  What's this? Why, Schioppettino, of course. One of the many great grapes indigenous to Friuli, Schiopettino makes medium-bodied red wines with floral notes and rustic acidity. Pair this with gamey foods or hard cheeses..<br />
  #15638<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Valpolicella, Le Ragose (2004) </strong> <br />

This staff favorite hails from the eastern part of the Valpolicella sub-region. Made from some well-loved grapes indigenous to the area (Corvina, Corvinone, Molinara, Rondinella) as well as some not-so-common ones (Croatina, Dindarella, Forsellina, Oseleta, and Rossignola), this is a dry, voluptuous, concentrated red wine with flavors of dark berries and currants.<br />
