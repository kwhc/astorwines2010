    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Argentina    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Pie de Palo, Viognier     (2007) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">This is a dry, unoaked white wine that is full of delicate aromas of ripe pineapple and citrus fruits. Great with a wide range of dishes, this is the perfect accompaniment to white meat or seafood.<br />
#18439<br />
  Sale Price: $5.94</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Ros&eacute; of Malbec &quot;Crios&quot;, Balbo (2007)</strong><br />
  This ros&eacute; is deep cherry in color and made from the Malbec grape variety, which has been absolutely thriving in Argentina's Mendoza region lately. This is very easy to drink: ripe, soft, and full of dark berry fruit on the palate - black cherries and red currants. Susana Balbo and her husband have been making wine in Argentina for over 25 years, producing many excellent wines that are well worth a try.<br />
  #13322<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Jelu Syrah   (2006) </strong><br />
  The Muscat grape makes beautifully aromatic white wines. This is full of white flowers, white pepper, and grapefruit notes. According to the Zind-Humbrecht domaine practice of indicating the dryness of each wine with a number of stars (one star being the driest and five the sweetest), this is a two: It's never cloying on the palate, but finishes on the off-dry side.<br />
  #14889<br />
  Sale Price:   $8.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Catena, Cabernet Sauvignon          (2005)</strong> <br />
  One of Argentina's emerging stars, Catena has produced this deeply hued, full-bodied Cabernet that combines rich Napa-like fruit with mineral and spice notes. Reminiscent of the best Bordeaux reds.<br />
  #55074<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Piazzolla Malbec, Mendoza (2005)  </strong><br />
  When wine drinkers think of Argentina, Malbec is what usually comes to mind. This version is unoaked, allowing you to appreciate all of the wonderful flavors of Malbec grown in the Mendoza region. This bottle is packed with rich, dark, jammy berry fruit.<br />
  #12804<br />
  Sale Price: $5.94<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Vi&ntilde;a Alicia Petit Verdot &quot;Cuarzo&quot;, Lujan de Cuyo (2005) </strong><br />
  Petit Verdot is one of those little-known grape varieties that originated in the Bordeaux region of France. This exemplary bottling is rich, full-bodied, and spicy, with red currants and cherries on the palate.<br />
  #19477<br />
  Sale Price: $45.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Weinert Star Malbec (1977) </strong><br />
  Malbec has the substance to be aged for decades, and this bottle proves it. This wine is just coming into its own, showing all of its Old World character. The palate is full of warm spices, eucalyptus, and blackberries. All in all this is a revelation; not many people have tasted Argentine wine like this.<br />
  #11389<br />
  Sale Price:   $169.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Benmarco Malbec (2006) </strong><br />
  Susana Balbo makes this supple and full-bodied red from 50-year-old vines. The age of the vines gives this wine uncommon richness and concentration, making it an extraordinarily sophisticated Malbec.<br />
  #75487<br />
  Sale Price: $16.14<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Kaleido Bonarda, Vista Flores Vineyards (2006) </strong> <br />
  Bonarda is one of the most popular and successful red grapes grown in Argentina. This fantastic wine is from the Mendoza region and gives us everything we want in a full-bodied red: spice, lush black fruit (blueberries and blackberries), and medium grip from the tannins.<br />
  #14421<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Sparkling Ros&eacute; of Malbec &quot;CJR&quot;, Reginato Celestina  (2007) </strong><br />
If you're already hooked on the Terra Sparkling Malbec, maybe you'd like to try a ros&eacute; version of this Argentine bubbly. This is a rich cherry color and shows amazing cherry fruit. It's nicely sparkling with a bright, pretty, dry finish.<br />
  #19697<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Torrontes &quot;Crios,&quot; Susana Balbo   (2007) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  Exotic, aromatic, rich, complex, and deep, this wine shows a surprising side of Torront&eacute;s. Beautiful floral notes are accompanied by honeysuckle, citrus and apple aromas, and are followed up by impressive balance and great length. This white goes perfectly with rich, saucy seafood dishes.<br />
