    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Burgundy    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Bourgogne Rouge, La Burgette      (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">The great wine region of Burgundy actually has one of the least varied ranges of vine varieties. This red is made from the habit-forming Pinot Noir, and it is full of freshly crushed raspberries and cherries on the palate. It makes a wonderful match for roast chicken, duck, and cured meats.<br />
#18411<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Bourgogne Rouge, Dom. d'Ardhuy (2006)</strong><br />
  Sometimes you find a wine that's so fresh on the palate and easy to drink that you'll find you've nearly finished the bottle &ndash; and your friends haven&rsquo;t even arrived yet! That will very likely be the case when you try this Pinot Noir. We consider this a must-try and a perfect red Burgundy to keep around by the case.<br />
  #17715<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Bourgogne Aligot&eacute;, Dom. des Remparts   (2006) </strong><br />
  The little-known Aligot&eacute; grape has come a long way. In our opinion, this light-bodied bottling reflects everything this white wine should offer: freshness, approachable fruit, and all-around appeal. It is excellent with seafood soups, and virtually any dish containing shellfish.<br />
  #17710<br />
  Sale Price:   $11.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. M&acirc;con-Villages, Guillot-Broux           (2004)</strong> <br />
  Here is a ripe and floral white Burgundy that shows the perfect amount of evolution. Though the wine was aged 50% in tank and 50% in barrel, there is no appreciable oak on the palate. There is, however, a strong surge of mineral; if this doesn't send you running to the nearest plate of oysters, nothing will.<br />
  #20442<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. St. Aubin Rouge &quot;Rouges Gorges&quot;, Prudhon (2004)  </strong><br />
  Henri Prudhon makes stellar Burgundy, from both Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The &quot;Rouges Gorges&quot; Pinot Noir is a lighter expression of the grape, with fresh, up-front, delicate raspberry and violet fruit. Always turn to small village wines for value in Burgundy.<br />
  #12630<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Chablis &quot;Les Serres&quot;, Dom. Oudin (2005) </strong><br />
  The &ldquo;Les Serres&rdquo; parcel of land is full of chalk soils and minerals, which end up defining this Chardonnay. It&rsquo;s very steely and youthful on the palate, with citrus fruits and honey. This wine is vinified and fermented in tanks without the use of any sulfites; it&rsquo;s also completely unoaked.<br />
  #10743<br />
  Sale Price: $19.54<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Sauvignon de Saint-Bris, De Moor (2006) </strong><br />
  Oenology school in Beaune revealed to the De Moors how not to make wine. Minimal manipulation, severe pruning to reduce yields, and aging in old oak rather than stainless steel results in a Sauvignon Blanc that defies the norm with creamy richness and lush, pulpy fruit.<br />
  #20309<br />
  Sale Price:   $22.92<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Month&eacute;lie, Jean Garaudet  (2006) </strong><br />
  The village of Month&eacute;lie is primarily known for the brilliant red wines it produces. This Pinot Noir is no exception: packed with color and red berry fruit (just as the winemaker intended), it has enormous immediate appeal.<br />
  #21275<br />
  Sale Price: $25.49<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Pommard, Joseph Voillot (2004) </strong> <br />
  Classic Pommard fruit aromas: cherries with an earthy element and a touch of game. This Burgundy is so giving that you'll find it hard to cellar this bottle.<br />
  #12770<br />
  Sale Price: $40.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Pouilly-Fuiss&eacute; &quot;Les M&eacute;n&eacute;tri&egrave;res&quot; Ferret  (1997) </strong><br />
&quot;Les M&eacute;n&eacute;tri&egrave;res&quot; was the favorite of Colette Ferret's father, who told her as a child that should tough times lie ahead, she could part with the other vineyards - but never with &quot;M&eacute;n&eacute;tri&egrave;res.&quot; The wine is seductively feminine in texture, creamy and redolent of green apples and chamomile.<br />
  #20337<br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Meursault &quot;Perri&egrave;res&quot;, Bitouzet-Prieur   (2003) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  A complex Meursault from a winemaker who is a staunch traditionalist in the cellar. This is full of raw honey, yellow apples, and quince fruit on the palate. The warm conditions of 2003 made the wine a bit fuller-bodied than most Meursault.<br />
  #19295<br />
  Sale Price: </span><span class="style2">$46.74</span></p>
