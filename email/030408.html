    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Portuguese Dry  Wines</span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
    <strong>11.   Vinho Verde, Provam  (2006)</strong><br />
  	This tasty white comes from the area of Mon&ccedil;&atilde;o in the Vinho Verde region of northern Portugal. It&rsquo;s dry on the palate, offering firm minerals and notes of tarragon and green apples. A natural match for anything seafood-based, but also very refreshing all by itself on a warm spring day. <br />
  #16348</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Fonte de Serrana, Vinho Regional Alentejano (2004) </strong><br />
  A blend of Arag&oacute;nez (a.k.a. Tempranillo) and the local red grape called Trincadeira. This is a voluptuous Portuguese red wine that's packed with dark berries on the palate and finishes with hints of dark chocolate.<br />
  #16535</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Mt. Ravasqueira, Alentejoe (2004)</strong> <br />
  The Alentejo region is full of rare gems like this blend of indigenous Portuguese grape varieties. A full-bodied red wine, it is full of dark berries and spice on the palate. The tannins are silky and give the wine a depth that makes it a natural match for rich, meat-based dishes.<br />
  #18503<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Santa F&eacute; de Arraiolos, Vinho Regional Alentejano (2006)</strong><br />
  An excellent wine if you're looking for something that's dark, rich, and dripping with black fruit flavors. It's fresh and lightly tannic, making it a perfect pairing for most meat-based cuisines.<br />
  #19451<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. &quot;FP&quot; Filipa Pato &quot;Ensaios&quot;, Baga (2005)</strong><br />
  This Portuguese red wine is made from the daughter of Luis Pato, Filipa. This is a rich, red wine made from a blend of  the local grapes Touriga Nacional, Baga and Alfrocheira. The grapes are vinified in steel tanks before going into barrel. There's a distinct smokiness on the palate with a lot of dark berries, blueberries and espresso foam on the finish.<br />
  #18455<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Auratus, Alvarinho-Trajadura (2006)</strong><br />
  A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, Auratus is a Portuguese white that goes beyond your traditional Vinho Verde. Very clean and fresh, this has notes of honey and ripe apples, with vivid acidity and mineral notes.<br />
  #12427<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. Monte das &Acirc;nforas, Herdade das &Acirc;nforas (2006)</strong><br />
  This hearty red wine comes from southern Portugal's Alentejo region. Based on the Arag&oacute;nez grape (a.k.a. Tempranillo), with some Trincadeira and Alfrocheiro blended in, it is full of mixed black berry flavors. Unoaked and showing incredible fruit concentration, this is drinking terrifically well today.<br />
  #17701<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4. Alvarinho, Portal do Fidalgo   (2005)</strong><br />
  This Portuguese white wine comes from the Vinho Verde region. It's a light-bodied dry white with flinty minerality, aromas of white peaches and a note of spearmint on the finish. Delicious with seafood.<br />
  #12723<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Tinto da Anfora, Herdade das Anforas   (2005)</strong><br />
  This tasty wine from southern Portugal is laden with dark berry fruit. Made from a blend of red grapes, it is aged in oak for 12 months. This is one of those wines that's just easy to love.<br />
  #18153  
  <br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. Qta. de Sta. Eufemia &quot;Garrafeira&quot;, Douro (2001) </strong><br />
  This wine is produced in the Douro using traditional grapes normally used to make port.  Toasted notes of vanilla and coffee burst from the glass while velvety tannins and red berry flavors linger on the finish.<br />
  #18823<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. Cardeal Reserva, Touriga Nacional, D&atilde;o </strong></span><strong class="style2"> (2002) </strong><br />  
        <span class="style2">Made from Touriga Nacional, this fresh red wine shows firm dark fruit, warm spices, and a gentle touch of fresh tobacco on the finish. It has a great tannic structure that allows it to hold up to big, meaty dishes.<br />
