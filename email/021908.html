    <span class="style4">Our Top 11 California Zinfandels</span><br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
    <strong>11. Cline Zinfandel Ancient Vines (2006) </strong><br />
  	This mouth-coating Zinfandel offers flavors of toasted caramel and dark berries. With soft tannins and a lasting vanilla finish, the Ancient Vine Zin is dangerously easy drinking.<br />
    </span><span class="style2"><br />
      <strong>10. Klinker Brick Old Vines Zinfandel (2005) </strong><br />
    This hearty, full-bodied red comes from Zinfandel vines that are well over 50 years old. The wine shows intense concentration, packed with berry flavors set off by spicy oak, and aromas of dark fruit contrasting with fresh herbal notes.</span><span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
    <strong>9. Zinfandel, Seghesio (2005)</strong> <br />
    In 1895, the Seghesio family came to Sonoma and planted their first Zinfandel vines.  This Sonoma Zinfandel is a collage of fruit from four estate-owned vineyards and exhibits briar, spice, and rich berry character.<br />
  <br />
    <strong>8. Ballentine Napa Zinfandel (2002)</strong><br />
    We're excited to add this new Zinfandel to our collection. This winery takes care to find a true expression of the grape variety, using careful practices in both the cellar and vineyard. Richly textured fruit and good balance abound in this wonderfully priced Cali Zin. Well done.<br />
  <br />
    <strong>7. St. Francis &quot;Pagani Ranch&quot; Zinfandel (2003)</strong><br />
  Coming from the famed Pagani Ranch Vineyard in Sonoma, this Zinfandel is spicy and rich.  The vines are over a century old, producing concentrated and intense fruit.  The wine is aged in American oak barrels, lending it vanilla and spice notes.<br />
  <br />
    <strong>6. Rosenblum Zinfandel Cuv&eacute;e XXIX (NV)</strong><br />
  With soft red fruit and nice tangy acidity, Rosenblum's Vintner's Cuv&eacute;e is always a dependable performer.  Enjoy this bright, spicy red with flavorful meats, cheeses, or pastas.<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>5. Mauritson Zinfandel, Dry Creek (2005)</strong><br />
  The Mauritsons have been growing grapes in Sonoma since the 1870s.  Beginning with the 1998 vintage, the family (led by winemaker Clay Mauritson) has been making its own wine. The fruit for this Dry Creek Zinfandel comes from four different vineyard sites, creating a wine that is complex and well balanced, with notes of dark chocolate and black plum.<br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>4. Saxon Brown Zinfandel, Casa Santinamaria (2003)</strong><br />
  This offers up an incredibly expressive nose, with loads of cedary spice, grape leaf, and tobacco, leading to jammy fruit and a hint of milk chocolate on the palate with an earthy underlay. Restrained for a Zinfandel, it is front-loaded with ample purple fruits in the mouth before revealing its tight-grained structure and deep core of old-vine fruit, revealing shades of earth and cocoa on the long finish.  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Nalle Zinfandel, Dry Creek Valley (2004)</strong><br />
  Lovely raspberry aromas and dry, earthy aromatics greet the nose, along with a moderate dose of oak. This medium-bodied Zin shows good acidity and tannins that are supportive yet unobtrusive. It has succulent, intense strawberry fruit on the palate, and a finish that is a touch compressed at the moment. Lingering earth and light toast notes frame the brambly fruit. This is an exceptionally civilized California Zinfandel.  <br />
  </span><span class="style2"><br />
  <strong>2. Ridge Geyserville Sonoma (2005) </strong><br />
  Geyserville was Ridge's first source of red wine grapes, along with Montebello.  This is Ridge's most age-worthy Zinfandel, showing pepper, tar, and cedar when young, and rich mocha as it ages.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. Sobon Estate Zinfandel, Hillside</strong></span><strong> (2006) </strong><br />  
  <span class="style2">This delicious Zinfandel is produced from old vines in Amador County.  Flavors of cocoa and blackberries ooze from the glass, making this sturdy and bold wine an absolute joy with hard cheeses or a grilled steak.</span></p>
