<p><span class="style1">our top 11: </span><br />
    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">California Chardonnays  </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Calera Chardonnay, Central Coast   (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">For decades, Josh Jensen has produced benchmark Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays while tirelessly promoting the Central Coast. In the typical Calera style, this wine exhibits bright orchard fruits - particularly apples and nectarines - with a lovely note of baking spice adding complexity and depth. This wine displays unusually succulent acidity for a California Chardonnay, and is a superb match for your summer grilled fish dishes.<br />
#67604<br />
  Sale Price: $14.44</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. R. Mondavi Chardonnay Carneros (2005)</strong><br />
  One of the most famous California Chardonnays, this wine from Robert Mondavi is versatile and extremely easy to drink. Its lush, buttery texture supports clear, bright fruit flavors.<br />
  #64384<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Frog's Leap Chardonnay, Napa   (2006) </strong><br />
  One of the first Certified Organic wineries in the heart of Napa at Rutherford, Frog's Leap winery combines dedicated winemaking with a fun spirit. This is a food-friendly Chardonnay, with clean acidity, a hint of nuttiness, and lemon-zest aromas.<br />
  #13703<br />
  Sale Price:   $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Melville Estate Chardonnay         (2006)</strong> <br />
  Melville is owned by father and son Ron and Chad Melville, with Greg Brewer as their winemaker. After owning several vineyards in Napa, Ron Melville came to Santa Rita and never looked back. The Santa Rita Hills appellation's microclimate, which is characterized by cool temperatures, prominent coastal winds, and foggy mornings, is well suited to growing the classic Burgundy grapes. This Chardonnay offers aromas of toast, white peaches, and grapefruit. It is refreshingly bright and carries a lengthy finish.<br />
  #12400<br />
  Sale Price: $24.64<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Porter Creek Chardonnay (2006 )  </strong><br />
  This winery, named after one of the main tributaries to the Russian River, is run by a father and son. The vineyards are farmed organically and the winemaking practices are Burgundian in style. This Chardonnay took us completely by surprise when we first tasted it: great Old World-style minerality complements notes of pear, lime, and brul&eacute;e.<br />
  #13475<br />
  Sale Price: $24.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Eberle Chardonnay (2006) </strong><br />
  This is packed with bright green apple flavors and carefully integrated oak that never detracts from the fresh, beautiful fruit. There's a biscuit and vanilla bean aroma on the finish that makes this a prime wine for the dinner table, but it could easily double as an ap&eacute;ritif.<br />
  #18449<br />
  Sale Price: $11.89<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Arcadian Chardonnay, Sleepy Hollow Young Viness  (2005) </strong><br />
  Joe Davis is a master of California winemaking. He studied in Burgundy, adopting many Old World techniques, and later brought them to his efforts in Santa Barbara, California. This Chardonnay will remind you of a white Burgundy, but it shows more exuberant notes of citrus, white flowers, and stony minerals on the finish. A sophisticated California Chardonnay.<br />
  #18421<br />
  Sale Price:   $23.79<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Varner Chardonnay, Amphitheater Block    (2004) </strong><br />
  Twin Brothers Jim and Bob Varner have created beautiful wines in the Santa Cruz Mountains since 1980. They produce single-block wines based on microclimate and soil types. The Amphitheater Block is the most Chablisienne of all of the Varner Chardonnays, with a hint of smokiness on the nose, citrus on the palate, and a long, minerally finish.<br />
  #14467<br />
  Sale Price: $28.04<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Lioco Chardonnay, Sonoma County (2007) </strong> <br />
  Lioco has created this Chardonnay from a blend of different sources, with all fruit grown in dried creek beds throughout the Russian River. The wine is left in contact with the lees for six months, it does not see any oak, and it is bottled unfined and unfiltered. Fresh citrus notes play against a creamy mouthfeel.<br />
  #18154<br />
  Sale Price: $15.29<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Freeman Chardonnay, Ryo-Fu  (2004) </strong><br />
Located in the heart of the Russian River, Freeman sets out to make elegant, Burgundian Chardonnays in each vintage. The fruit for the Ryo-Fu Chardonnay comes from two different vineyard sites: a cooler Green Valley site and a warmer Russian River site. The &quot;blend&quot; (of 100% Chardonnay grapes) has a rich, lush mouthfeel with tropical fruit flavors in the nose and crisp acidity on the palate.<br />
  #15836<br />
  Sale Price: $50.99 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1.</strong></span><span class="style8"> Knights Valley Chardonnay   (2006) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  A great value from one of America&rsquo;s most highly regarded Chardonnay producers. Even beyond its impeccable pedigree, this wine gives us a lot to get excited about: hand-picked, hand-sorted fruit; native yeast fermentation; 100% French oak barrels (all 2 and 3 years old); high-altitude vineyards; cool-climate growing conditions; volcanic soils; and traditional winemaking practices. This wine turned out rich and delicious, and it's drinking very well today.<br />
