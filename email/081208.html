    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Piedmont    </span> <br />

  <span class="style2"></span><span class="style2">Made by a tiny husband-and-wife winery in Monferrato, this red is just lightly sparkling on the palate - just like the Piedmontese enjoy their Freisa. On the dry side, with lively black cherries and a tiny hit of spice.<br />
#14498<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Grignolino &quot;Poggeto&quot;, La Casaccia (2006)</strong><br />
  This tasty red from Piedmont is made from the Grignolino grape variety and comes from 50-year-old vines. The pale red cherry color is captivating. On the palate: the freshest imaginable red berry fruit and white peppercorn character. This red has such pristine fruit and great mineral-laced acidity that you'll be aching for more before you know it.<br />
  #12753<br />

  <br />
  <strong>9. Nebbiolo d'Alba, Giacosa   (2006) </strong><br />
  If you'd like an introduction to this fine estate's wines, start with this Nebbiolo, showing all the beauty of this grape we adore: violets, light tar, almonds, and red berry fruit. The notable clay minerality adds an extra layer of complexity to this wine.<br />
  #11423<br />
  Sale Price:   $38.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. Pelaverga, Vigna di Terre Rosse           (2004)</strong> <br />
  This is a beautiful, bright crimson-colored wine made from the rare Pelaverga grape. It is shy upon opening, but within a couple of hours begins to show fresh cranberry fruit with vivid aromas of flowers, spice, clay, and powder. Delicately textured with a subtle iron minerality on the finish. Just another humble yet amazing Piedmontese wine, well worthy of a patient taster's attention. This comes from the Saluzzo area (southwest of Turin), which is known as the original home of Pelaverga.<br />
  #13001<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Barbera d'Alba, Oddero (2005)  </strong><br />
  Barbera is known for its racy acidity, its rusticity, its earthiness, and its need to be accompanied by food. So reach for the nearest plate of grilled wild mushrooms or gamey meats and get ready to fall in love with this gorgeous, classically structured Barbera.<br />
  #20287<br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Gavi, Nuova Abbazia di Vallechiara (2006) </strong><br />
  A dry Gavi with delicate stony minerals balanced perfectly against bright citrus and floral fruit. This has a remarkable unoaked freshness; it is excellent with seafood dishes, and amazing with chowder.<br />
  #19626<br />

  <br />
  <strong>5. Dolcetto d'Alba &quot;Roussot&quot;, Rinaldi (2007) </strong><br />
  This dry red wine comes from the Roussot vineyard plot, and is full of really dark-berried fruits. A brilliant Dolcetto with a sophisticated earthy element and incredible minerality on the finish.<br />
  #19698<br />
  Sale Price:   $14.44<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Ruch&egrave; &quot;Na Vota&quot;, Sant'Agata  (2006) </strong><br />
  Very little Ruch&egrave; (&quot;roo-KAY&quot;) is grown in Italy, so we feel very lucky whenever we get our hands on some in New York. This is a graceful red wine with floral aromas - violets especially - alongside red currant and cherry notes. Soft tannins and good acidity make food a must with this wine.<br />
  #12299<br />
  Sale Price: $16.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Arneis, Brovia (2006) </strong> <br />
  The Brovia estate of Piedmont is a favorite among our Barolo collectors. This wine, made from the Arneis grape, is their only white. This is a gorgeous dry white wine with aromas of pears, apples, acacia honey, and almonds. A silken texture makes it very satisfying alone, and it's stunning with white meats or seafood.<br />
  #44991<br />
  Sale Price: $21.24<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Barbaresco, De Forville  (2004) </strong><br />
The De Forville family emigrated to Piedmont from Belgium in 1848 and established themselves in the village of Barbaresco in 1860. This wine is very accessible, full of red berries (currants and cherries) and leathery tannins on the finish. It's packed with fruit and drinking extremely well today.<br />
