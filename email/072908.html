    <span class="style2"><span class="style5">Wines of Beaujolais    </span> <br />
    (... we go to eleven)<br />
    <br />
  <strong>11.   </strong></span><span class="style2"><strong>Morgon, Lapierre      (2006) </strong></span><strong class="style2"> </strong><br />
  <span class="style2">We're very glad to be able to reap the benefits of Lapierre's fanatical grape-growing: this is amazing for the beauty of its fruit and the purity of its flavor.<br />
#11341<br />
  Sale Price: $18.67</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><strong>10. Beaujolais &quot;Pierre Chermette&quot;, Vissoux (2007)</strong><br />
  Brimming with fresh, bright, red raspberry fruit, this is a thirst-quenching wine of purity and finesse. It shines even among the scores of lively Beaujolais bottlings on the market today.<br />
  #21118<br />
  Sale Price: $12.74<br />
  <br />
  <strong>9. Ch&eacute;nas, C. Pacalet   (2006) </strong><br />
  The northern part of Beaujolais is divided into ten &quot;crus,&quot; the smallest of which is known as Ch&eacute;nas. Christophe Pacalet's Ch&eacute;nas bottling, made from Gamay, is a touch gamey, with pure aromas of freshly crushed mixed berries. This is a wine that cries out for food.<br />
  #17123<br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8. C&ocirc;te-de-Brouilly &quot;Terres Dorees&quot; Jean-Paul Brun           (2006)</strong> <br />
  Jean-Paul Brun refuses to use laboratory yeasts or add sugar to his wines - two practices that are very common in Beaujolais. His wines turn out light-bodied, juicy, and eminently quaffable: this one is brimming with red fruit.<br />
  #20318<br />
  Sale Price: $13.59<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7. Morgon VV, Daniel Bouland (2006)  </strong><br />
  One of the 10 crus of the Beaujolais region, Morgon is noted for producing wines with darker, more powerful fruit profiles than are typical of the Gamay grape. Excellent character with a rustic, earthy edge that pairs well with the charcuterie (sausages, hams, country p&acirc;t&eacute;s) so widely enjoyed in the region &ndash; not to mention here in NYC.<br />
  #14222<br />
  Sale Price: $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Beaujolais-Villages VV, Ch. du Chatelard (2006) </strong><br />
  This old-vine Beaujolais shows bright red fruit with underlying notes of clay and limestone minerality. Flavors of wild blackberries and currants abound, with a hint of earth just beneath the surface. Bright, lively acidity makes this an excellent food wine.<br />
  #19957<br />
  Sale Price: $10.19<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5. Chiroubles, C. Pacalet (2006) </strong><br />
  A wine of character with distinct terroir. It has an earthy edge, but it&rsquo;s the fruit that shines here: ripe raspberries, orange rind, cherry, and a touch of musk. Very fresh and very pretty, yet maintaining a mien of rusticity, the wine is produced organically, with no sulphur added.<br />
  #11953<br />
  Sale Price:   $16.99<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4. Fleurie, Clos de Roilette  (2006) </strong><br />
  Complex, structured, broad-shouldered cru Beaujolais with pure berry fruit, floral notes, and herbal accents. Excellent now, and even better in five years.<br />
  #16851<br />
  Sale Price: $18.69<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Fleurie &quot;Garants&quot;, Vissoux (2007) </strong> <br />
  This is a rare cuv&eacute;e from the Vissoux domaine. A gem of a Beaujolais with great minerality, red berries, and amazing freshness, this bottle could even be aged for a few years.<br />
  #19232<br />
  Sale Price: $22.09<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Beaujolais-Villages, La Burgette  (2006) </strong><br />
Sometimes people forget that Beaujolais is actually a part of Burgundy. It's located at the southern end of the region, and is made from Gamay, Burgundy&rsquo;s &ldquo;other red grape.&rdquo; This bottle is full of tangy red fruits and makes a delightful match for sausages or even grilled salmon.<br />
  #18416<br />
  Sale Price: $8.49 <br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. </strong></span><span class="style8">Brouilly, &quot;Corentin,&quot; Martray   (2006) </span><span class="style2"><br />
  A fantastic cru Beaujolais that will entice all fanatics. This is full of intriguing fruit character: dark cherries, blood orange, graphite and even a bit of musk. The finish is mineraled, with modest tannins. This is a solid example of a Brouilly that is drinking well now, and can be held for a few years to come.<br />
