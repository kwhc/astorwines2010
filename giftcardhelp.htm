    <p>
    To ensure that there will be no delay in processing your order, our policy is to require a credit card number for all Gift Card transactions. Your credit card WILL NOT BE CHARGED unless the amount of your invoice exceeds the balance on your Gift Card. If your order does exceed your balance, the amount of the difference will be charged to your credit card.<br />
     For example: if you have a $50 Gift Card and you place a $51 order, your credit card will be charged exactly $1. If you have a $50 Gift Card and you place a $25 order, no charge will be made to your credit card.
